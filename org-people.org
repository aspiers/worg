I am the main Org-mode author, being on this project since 2003.

Just like my earlier Emacs hacks [[http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/reftex.html][RefTeX]], [[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/cdlatex/][CDLaTeX]], and [[http://idlwave.org][IDLWave]], writing
[[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] resulted from a direct need for it: I wanted to get organized
and wanted to do it in Emacs.  There was nothing available that fit my
wishes, in particular no combination of outline-based note-taking with
task management in a single system.

With lots of help from the community around Org-mode, this project has
grown into a versatile toolbox, which is being used by a large number
of people, in various ways and to various ends.

Org-mode was largely written on the commuter train to Amsterdam, where
I [[http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dominik/][work]] as an [[http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html][Astronomer]] at the [[http://www.astro.uva.nl][Astronomical Institute]] of the
[[http://www.uva.nl][University of Amsterdam]].

I am a computer scientist working with chemical engineers, doing
research in optimisation and automated design methods.  Org-mode is a
key tool in the management of both my research programme and my
teaching activities.

Being based on simple text files and being open source, Org-mode is
attractive for being future-proof.  It allows me to no longer worry
about whether I'm locked in to some software vendor's changing view of
what is important or necessary and I know that all the information I
have put into my org files is and always will be accessible.

Org-mode provides me with an excellent framework for collaborative
work.  As it is available on a very wide range of devices, including
hand-held computers, the full power of the system is at hand no matter
where I am working.

My [[http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucecesf/][web pages]], describing my research activities and interests, are all
written in Org.  Lately, I have been experimenting with literate
programming using Org with the recently added org-babel framework!

My contribution to the Org-mode project is mostly as an enthusiastic
user!

Over the past decade, I have been studying philosophy, cognitive
sciences and educational theories.  I'm interested on how to use
computers for education, and I'm a consultant in this field.

I'm not a programmer but I've been raised in Emacs, so I can read 
some elisp code, fix some bugs and sometimes write a function.

My first Emacs contribution was [[http://directory.fsf.org/project/BHL/][BHL]], a mode to convert plain text to
HTML, LaTeX, etc.  When I discovered Org I thought: "Wow.  This is the
perfect tool for playing with ideas I'm too lazy to implement in BHL."
And it turned out to be much more than that: Org has been a matrix for
many new ideas that I couldn't have dreamt for with BHL.

Org is to Emacs what Emacs is to computers.

And nothing compares to the Org community.

{{{person(Bernt Hansen,http://www.norang.ca/pics/Bernt.jpg)}}}

I am a freelance software designer working from my office near Toronto,
Ontario, Canada.  I use Org-mode to track all of my personal and
business tasks.

Org-mode was the end of my long quest to find a better organizational
toolkit.  I had tried many other systems over the years in an attempt to
get organized.

I started using Org-mode in August 2006 after trying out planner for a
year.  I needed something to track time spent on tasks and a note filing
system where I could actually find the notes back again and in a
reasonable amount of time.  Being able to actually read the note was an
added bonus -- my handwriting is awful - especially when I'm in a hurry
such as making notes during a client conversation.  Fortunately for me I
can type faster than I can write.

Since then Org-mode has continued to evolve and it has many more
features than I will ever need from my organizational software suite.
I'm no longer searching for a better organizational toolkit.

{{{person300(Manish Sharma,http://www.vyom.org/media/manish-org.jpg)}}}

I had tried dozens of task management tools of various kinds
(web-based, browser-based, wiki-style, MS Excel-based, paper-based, MS
Outlook-based, plain text file based, Post-It based... you get the
idea) between 2003 and 2007. I really tried to like them... but
something or the other was always amiss.  Planner was the first system
that I kept going back to after trying every fancy new system; I kept
looking around until I found Org-mode around August 2007 and that was
the end of my journey. It was like finding out who you are going to
spend the rest of your life with. :)

I initially thought Org was awesome and could not be improved further
but I had underestimated Carsten, various contributors and the amazing
community of users who keep pushing the envelope of what is possible
without sacrificing the deceptive simplicity of the system.

It morphs into the perfect system to suit any new-fangled ideas I
might have about organizing and approaching work. To me, Org is like a
DIY-kit of organizers -- it scales as you grow and discover and tune
how you would like to organize your life.  I doubt if I will ever need
or use full power of Org.

{{{person(Stefan Vollmar,http://www.hardakers.net/images/wes-tammerack.jpg)}}}

I like to bite off more than I can chew on a regular basis.  I'm
actively involved in a ton of things.  I'm an avid
[[http://www.capturedonearth.com/][Photographer]], a
[[http://www.ws6z.com/][Amateur Radio]] enthusiast, and Community Emergency
Response Team supporter.  I love hiking
([[http://www.openstreetmap.org/][making maps of everywhere I go]] and
enjoy finding [[http://yamar.geoqo.org/][Geocaching]].  All of this
takes coordination, organization and careful tracking of the things
that I fail to get done.  I think faster than my fingers can write
down [[http://pontifications.hardakers.net][my ideas and thoughts]].
Org-mode has certainly made managing my overwhelming list of things I
need to do, want to do or am simply thinking of much easier.  I don't
feel nearly as lost after I've started using it.

I participate in a [[http://www.hardakers.net/code/][large number of open source projects]] 
(both for work and pleasure) and have contributed at least
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-export-generic.php][at least
a little bit to org]] via my org-export-generic functionality.

Thanks a bunch to Carsten and everyone else for writing such a
wonderful package!
