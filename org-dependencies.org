* Dependencies

Certain parts of org-mode have dependencies on external packages. This
file documents these dependencies. Many sections are placeholders,
waiting for input. If you can, please contribute. If you think that
another section should be added, please add it and fill it out. Also,
if you spot any mistakes, omissions or superfluities, please fix
them. If you have an account, you can clone the Worg tree and make the
additions/fixes [[linkTBD]], but a note to the mailing list
[[linktomaillistTBD]] will also do the job. Thanks!

Version: Org-mode version 6.33trans (release_6.33f.192.ge1a1)

** TODO Exporting in general.

** TODO LaTeX export.

** STARTED PDF export.

PDF export goes through LaTeX export first, so all the LaTeX dependencies
apply here as well. In addition, PDF export imposes the following dependencies:

   - foo.

   - bar.

** TODO DocBook export.

** TODO HTML export.

** TODO org-plot.

** TODO org-babel.
