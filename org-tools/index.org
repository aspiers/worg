This page lists external tools useful for handling Org files.

* orgnode.py - python library for parsing Org files

: The Orgnode module contains one class, called Orgnode and a routine to read
: an org-mode file and create a list of Orgnode objects.
: 
: The module is for reading an org-mode file. There are no methods for
: writing org-mode since since I have no need for this functionality.
: 
: You are welcome to extend the functionality of the __repr__ method of the
: Orgnode class if you would like this functionality.
