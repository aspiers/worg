Do we need a FAQ for Org?

Yes, and the FAQ can be build by answering questions in the [[file:org-survey.org][survey]].

I think apart from the survey, we should use the faq to provide
pointers to especially useful posts on emacs-orgmode.  For example:

- Can I use the remember buffer for taking notes during a customers call
  and clock that call *in* the remember buffer?

  Yes, you can.  Take a look at the [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/5482][setup described by Bernt Hansen]].

- Can I implement a *GTD* workflow with Org-mode?

  Yes, you can.  Check for discussions and pointers [[http://orgmode.org/#sec-11][here]].

- How can I cycle through the *TODO* keyword of an entry ?

  =C-c C-t= or =S-<left/right>= is what you need.

- How can I quickly set the *tag* of an entry ?

  Yes. Use =C-c C-c=

- Can I select the TODO keywords with an interface similar to the one for
  selecting tags?

  Yes.  Use =(setq org-use-fast-todo-selection t)=

- I want to isearch to find strings in links, but those are hidden.
  What can I do?

  M-x =visible-mode= will display the full link, making them
  searchable.

- "=C-k= is killing whole subtrees!  I lost my work!"

  =(setq org-special-ctrl-k t)= before losing your work. 

- How can I set up automatic reminders based on Org information?

  See [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/5271][this post]] by N. Dokos on the list.
