Do we need a FAQ for Org?

Yes, and the FAQ can be build by answering questions in the [[file:org-survey.org][survey]].

I think apart from the survey, we should use the faq to provide
pointers to especially useful posts on emacs-orgmode.  For example:

# Feel free to restructure this file

- *Can I use the remember buffer for taking notes during a customers
  call and clock that call in the remember buffer?*

  Yes, you can.  Take a look at the [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/5482][setup described by Bernt Hansen]]
  and check out (in the same thread) what Nick Docos had to fix to
  make Bernt's set-up work for him.

- *Can I implement a GTD workflow with Org-mode?*

  Yes, you can.  Check for discussions and pointers [[http://orgmode.org/#sec-11][here]].

- *How can I cycle through the TODO keyword of an entry ?*

  =C-c C-t= or =S-<left/right>= is what you need.

- *How can I quickly set the tag of an entry ?*

  Yes. Use =C-c C-c= on the headline.

- *Can I select the TODO keywords with an interface similar to the one
  for selecting tags?*

  Yes.  Use =(setq org-use-fast-todo-selection t)=

- *I want to isearch to find strings in links, but those are hidden.
  What can I do?*

  M-x =visible-mode= will display the full link, making them
  searchable.

- *C-k is killing whole subtrees!  I lost my work!*

  =(setq org-special-ctrl-k t)= before losing your work. 

- *How can I set up automatic reminders based on Org information?*

  See [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/5271][this post]] by N. Dokos on the list.
  
- *Is there a good way to create a description list?*

  Yes, by enforcing a line break in a plain list using :\\:, like this
  (following a suggestion by Sebastian Rose):

  : - *item1* \\
  :   Description of this item 1
  : - *item2* \\
  :   Description of this item 2
  : - *item1* \\
  :   Description of this item 3

- *I want to add my Org scheoduled/deadlined entries in my diary!*

  Put this in your ~/.diary:
  
  :&%%(org-diary :scheduled :timestamp :deadline)

- *How can I make =appt= notice my Org appointments?*

  :M-x org-agenda-to-appt RET
