[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] is a text editor.  [[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]] is an Emacs tool written by Carsten
Dominik which helps you organize your life with plain text files.  =Worg=
is a set of Org files collectively edited by people who like Org-mode and
want to share [[file:org-tutorials/index.org][tutorials]], ideas, code snippets, etc.

# For this dynamic block to work, you need to add elisp/worg.el in your
# load-path.

# Let say that you like [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and that you like using [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]] for editing
# structured files in Emacs.  Then you might want to /share/ some =.org=
# files and ask people to edit them with you.  This is what *Worg* is [[file:worg-about.org][about]]:
# collaboratively editing Org files to build a knowledge database about
# =.org= itself (and planning-related stuff.)

# You can also download Worg as a tar gzipped [[http://repo.or.cz/w/Worg.git%3Fa%3Dsnapshot%3Bh%3DHEAD%3Bsf%3Dtgz][archive]].

* Code around Org

You can check for code around code both in the =contrib/= directory of
the Org package and in the =code/= directory of Worg.

** org-info-js by Sebastian Rose

For now the =code/= directory of Worg only contains =org-info-js= by
Sebastian Rose -- check it [[http://orgmode.org/worg/code/][here]].  =org-info-js= is a great javascript
tool to navigate through a HTML page (as exported by Org) the way you
navigate through an Org or an info manual, i.e. supporting folding,
previous/next buttons, etc.
