* Org and GTD

#+index: GTD!Tutorials

Org-mode is flexible enough to implement many different ways of
organizing your projects.  A frequently discusses scheme is [[http://www.davidco.com/][David
Allen's]] strategy for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD][Getting Things Done]].  But it is clearly not the
only way to us Org-mode for planning.  Here are a couple of links
related to this topic.

    - [[https://nicolas.petton.fr/][Nicolas Petton]] has written a post on his setup of [[https://emacs.cafe/emacs/orgmode/gtd/2017/06/30/orgmode-gtd.html][Orgmode for GTD]].

    - [[http://johnwiegley.com][John Wiegley]] has written an excellent document describing his way of
      using Org-mode as a [[http://www.newartisans.com/2007/08/using-org-mode-as-a-day-planner/][day planner]]. See also some later messages for
      enhancements of his setup: [[https://orgmode.org/list/m2myw3fa2f.fsf@newartisans.com][emacs-orgmode-2962]], [[https://orgmode.org/list/m21wc7dz4r.fsf@newartisans.com][emacs-orgmode-3629]]

    - [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/charles57/Creative/][Charles Cave]] has written an [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgmode.html][article/tutorial]] about the basic elements
      of GTD and how he implements them in Org-mode.  There is also a
      [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/orgtutorial_dto-fr.html][french translation]] of this document.

      + More recently, Charles Cave has written another tutorial on [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/gtd_workflow.html][his GTD
        workflow in org-mode]], which includes a nice section on effort
        estimates and custom agenda commands for GTD.

    - There have been several threads on emacs-orgmode@gnu.org related to
      GTD, the most important ones are:

      + [[https://orgmode.org/list/ud59ipf8o.fsf@juniper.net][Another GTD question]], which contains a discussion about GTD and
        org-mode.
      + In the same thread, there is a [[https://orgmode.org/list/76f7cd71190bcff68e57e71d163fe49f@science.uva.nl][post by Carsten]] summarizing several
        options for implementing GTD in org-mode.
      + [[https://orgmode.org/list/m1wt9pr1y4.fsf@bertrand.carcosa.net][GTD, Projects and Next Actions in org-mode]] is a thread where
        several people describe their personal setup.
      + The [[https://orgmode.org/list/20071230181116.GE20947@atlantic.linksys.moosehall][SOMEDAY/MAYBE vs. low priorities]] thread contains a
        discussion about priorities that is quite instructive.
      + Here is a [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2007-12/msg00281.html][very instructive post]] by Pete Phillips explaining
        why David Allen's book is the best place to start learning GTD
        and that the Internet and Org-mode should only come into the
        game later, when you start thinking about the implementation.
        And since doing GTD the right way will give you lots of free
        time, don't forget to listen to [[http://www.detox-jazz.co.uk/][Pete's music]]!

    - Also on the web you can find information about how people are
      setting up Org-mode to fit their habits.  A few examples:

      + This [[http://www.brool.com/?p=82][blog post]] shows a very simple and clear GTD setup.

    - This tutorial on [[file:org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.org][custom agenda commands]] offers a few examples of
      how to make GTD reviews easier using custom agenda searches.

* Org and Pomodoro

#+index: Pomodoro

[[http://www.pomodorotechnique.com][Pomodoro]] is a time management technique.  In [[https://orgmode.org/list/AANLkTinZ5u5+1-SE5ptjoCsYVj0rHDTXx9SbbqKyadee@mail.gmail.com][this thread]], Frédéric Couchet
describes how he uses Org for Pomodoro:

: I always start a clock when I work on a task. And for the Pomodoro
: technique I use also the org-timer module with some configuration.
:
: Activate the org-timer module :
:
: (add-to-list 'org-modules 'org-timer)
:
: Set a default value for the timer, for example :
:
: (setq org-timer-default-timer 25)
:
: Modify the org-clock-in so that a timer is started with the default
: value except if a timer is already started :
:
: (add-hook 'org-clock-in-hook (lambda ()
:       (if (not org-timer-current-timer)
:       (org-timer-set-timer '(16)))))
