;; Purpose:
;;
;;  Mark and find your favorite org-locations and other things easily:
;;  Create and update a lookup table of references and links. Frequently
;;  used entries bubble to the top. Entering some keywords narrows down the
;;  displayed results to matching entries only, so that the right one can
;;  be spotted easily.
;;
;;  References are essentially small numbers (e.g. "R237" or "-455-"),
;;  which are created by this package; they are well suited to be used
;;  outside org. Links are normal org-mode links.;;
;;
;; Setup:
;;
;;  - Add these lines to your .emacs:
;;
;;    (require 'org-index)
;;
;;    ;; Optionally assign a key. Pick your own.
;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-+") 'org-index)
;;
;;  - Invoke `org-index', which will assist you to create your 
;;    index table.
;;
;;  - Do not forget to restart emacs to make these lines effective.
;;
;;
;; Further reading:
;;
;;  See the documentation of `org-index', which can also be read
;;  by invoking `org-index' and and choosing the help-command.
;;
;;  For more documentation and working examples, see:

;;    - New commands occur and multi-occur
;;    - All commands can now be invoked explicitly
;;    - New documentation
;;    - Many bugfixes

  "Mark and find your favorite things and org-locations easily:
Create and update a lookup table of references and links. Often
used entries bubble to the top; entering some keywords narrows
down to matching entries only, so that the right one can be
spotted easily.

References are essentially small numbers (e.g. \"R237\" or \"-455-\"),
which are created by this package; they are well suited to be used
outside of org. Links are normal org-mode links.

This is version 2.3.0 of org-index.

The function `org-index' operates on a dedicated table, the index
table, which lives within its own Org-mode node. The table and
its node will be created, when you first invoke org-index.

Each line in the index table contains:

 - A reference

 - A link

 - A number; counting, how often each reference has been
   used. This number is updated automatically and the table can
   be sorted after it, so that most frequently used references
   appear at the top of the table and can be spotted easily.

 - The creation date of the line.

 - Date and time of last access. This column can alternatively be
   used to sort the table.

 - A column for your own comments, which allows lines to be selected by
   keywords.

The index table is found through the id of the containing
node; this id is stored within `org-index-id'.


The function `org-index' is the only interactive function of this
package and its sole entry point; it offers several commands to
create, find and look up these favorites (references and links).

Commands known:

  occur: Incremental search, that after each keystroke shows
    matching lines from index table. You may enter a list of words
    seperated by comma (\",\"), to select lines that contain all
    of the given words.

    If you supply a number (e.g. \"237\"): Apply emacs standard
    multi-occur operation on all org-mode buffers to search for
    this specific reference.

    You may also read the note at the end of this help on saving
    the keystroke RET with this frequent default command.

  head: If invoked outside the index table, ask for a
    reference number and search for a heading containing it. If
    invoked within index table dont ask; rather use the reference or
    link from the current line.

  ref: Create a new reference, copy any previously selected text.
    If already within index table, fill in ref-column.

  link: Create a new line in index table with a link to the
    current node.  Do not populate the ref column; this can later
    be populated by calling the \"fill\" command from within the
    index table.

  leave: Leave the index table. If the last command has
    been \"ref\", the new reference is copied and ready to yank.
    This \"org-mark-ring-goto\" and can be called several times
    in succession. If you invoke org-index with a prefix argument,
    this command \"leave\" is executed without further questions.

  enter: Just enter the node with the index table.

  goto: Search for a specific reference within the index table.

  help: Show this text.

  +: Show all commands including the less frequently used ones
    given below. If \"+\" is followd by enough letters of such a
    command (e.g. \"+fi\"), then this command is invoked
    directly.

  reorder: Temporarily reorder the index table, e.g. by
    count, reference or last access.

  fill: If either ref or link is missing, fill it.

  sort: Sort a set of lines (either the active region or the
    whole buffer) by the references found in each line.

  update: For the given reference, update the line in the
    index table.

  highlight: Highlight references in region or buffer.

  unhighlight: Remove highlights.

  missing : Search for missing reference numbers (which do not
    appear in the reference table). If requested, add additional
    lines for them, so that the command \"ref\" is able to reuse
    them.

  statistics : Show some statistics (e.g. minimum and maximum
    reference) about index table.



Two ways to save keystrokes:

When prompting for a command, org-index puts the most likely
one (e.g. \"occur\" or \"ref\") in front of the list, so that
you may just type RET.

If this command needs additional input (like e.g. \"occur\"), you
may supply this input right away, although you are still beeing
prompted for the command. So, to do an occur for the string
\"foo\", you can just enter \"foo\" RET, without even typing
\"occur\".


Another way to save keystrokes applies if you want to choose a
command, that requrires a reference number (and would normally
prompt for it): In that case you may just enter enough characters
from your command, so that it appears first in the list of
matches; then immediately enter the number of the reference you
are searching for. So the input \"h237\" would execute the
command \"head\" for reference \"237\" right away.

  Detailed explanation:


  The index table above has three lines of headings above the first
  hline:

  - The first one is ignored by org-index, and you can use it to
    give meaningful names to columns. In the table above only one
    column has a name (\"comment\"). This line is optional.

  - The second line is the most important one, because it
    contains the configuration information for org-index; please
    read further below for its format.

  - The third line is again optional; it may only specify the
    widths of the individual columns (e.g. <4>).

  The columns get their meaning by the second line of headings;
  specifically by one of the keywords (e.g. \"ref\") or a flag
  seperated by a semicolon (e.g. \";s\").



  The keywords and flags are:


  - ref: This contains the reference, which consists of a decorated
    number, which is incremented for each new line. References are
    meant to be used in org-mode headlines or outside of org´,
    e.g. within folder names.

  - link: org-mode link pointing to the matching location within org.

  - created: When has this line been created ?

  - count: How many times has this line accessed ? The trailing
    flag \"s\" makes the table beeing sorted after
    this column, so that often used entries appear at the top of
    the table.

  - last-accessed: When has this line ben accessed

  - The last column above has no keyword, only the flag \"c\",
    which makes its content beeing copied under certain
    conditions. It is typically used for comments.

  The sequence of columns does not matter. You may reorder them any
  way you like. Columns are found by their name, which appears in
  the second line of headings.

  You can add further columns or even remove the last column. All
  other columns are required.


  Finally: This node needs not be a top level node; its name is
  completely at you choice; it is found through its ID only.
