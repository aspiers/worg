* 2010-11-24 Benny Simonsen Part 1

  * classNames for T.O.C links to highlight the current page in the TOC.

  * Add hooks.
    Currently, names of OrgNode's and OrgHtmlManger's members are different in
    plain and compressed versions of the script (see "sed.txt").  Should we
    change that for some of them?

* 2010-09-01 --- t.TITLE

  * Make sure the correct heading is used as the =org-html-manager.TITLE= property.

  * Thanks to tgbit on http://github.com/tgbit for the hint.

* 2010-04-24 --- Valid CSS2 IDs

  * Changed =org_html_manager::SID_REGEX= to match valid CSS-IDs. Dots are not
    valid in IDs as of CSS 2 (see http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/grammar.html). The
    regexp still supports the `old' style IDs we used to be backward
    compatible.

  * =SECNUM_REGEX= was not in use. Removed.

* 2010-02-14 --- Title and #sec-1 in plain view, TOC anywhere

  * Some corrections of indentation and obsolet comments.

  * Show the title in plain view mode, if showing the first section.

  * Make the initial scan work, even if the table of contents is somewhere else,
    but on top of the page. Honor the =[TABLE-OF-CONTENTS]= setting in Org-mode
    files this way.

  * Fix for different behaviour of Opera-10 when requesting a page with `#sec-1'
    jump target (any jump target for a tall section actually). Pressing the
    reload button caused Opera-10 to scroll the view to the sections heading in
    info view mode.

* 2010-01-11

  * Chao Lu was right. The current behaviour of VIEW=content is not what the
    documentation promises. This is now fixed, finally.

    To open a section in `...html?VIEW=content' or `...html?VIEW=overview', one
    has to explicitly request a section like this:

     `http://orgmode.org/worg/code/org-info-js/index.html?VIEW=content#sec-1'

  * Tags where not removed from local TOCs (sections with subsections).  Fix
    Regexp and use the right one.

  * When loading a page with the `?VIEW=...' query parameters, navigating
    changed the view mode to one hard coded in the <head> section of the
    document, in case it were different. This is now fixed.

* 2010-02-11

  * Inhibit reloading the page on startup.
    Fixes startup with `?VIEW=overview#sec-1'.

* 2009-07-06

  * Existing access-keys now use the same keys as the shortcuts do.
  * When FIXED_TOC, re-focus the last link in the TOC when pressing `i'.
  * Allow TAB to traverse the TOC.

* 2009-07-04

  * Jumping TOC. Seems fixed now (hopefully).
  * Added `W' for printing. For printing, the whole document has to be in plain
    view mode and expanded. Browsers print what's visible on screen only.

* 2009-06-28

  Show the version number below the shortcut table.

* 2009-06-27

  Bugfix for links nested in lists.
  Thanks to Xin Shi for finding this and sending a testfile.

* 2009-06-25

  * Fix for start section.
    I a section was removed and the *.org file was published again, we saw an
    empty page when browsing to that old location (e.g. =xy.html#sec-11=). Now the
    first section is shown instead.

* 2009-06-22

  * *NOTE: now GPL 3*

  * FIX: go to previous sibling, even if it's the first one.

  * Removed some more unused stuff and fixed typos (=this.INPUT_FIELD=, =DEBUG=...).

  * All names of regular expressions end in =_REGEX=.

  * FIX: Altering the history lead to jumping of the page.

  * Uppercase names everywehre. I want this to distinguish class fields from
    functions and temporary variables. Stay YUI compressor friendly when we
    shorten the names. Needed for the rest of the todays changes.

  * Replaced =this.= by a local variable where possible. Decreased org-info.js
    size by 1.8 Kb.

  * Add a Makefile target for realy small org-info.js. This is not exactly
    perfect, but decreases the resulting file by about 10 Kb.

  * Added =hacking.org= to explain what happens here a bit.

  * Reworked the Docs. Oha, I wonder how noone complained about that...

  * FIX html tags in local toc.

* 2009-06-17

  + Manipulate the histories current location.
    So if one clicks a link to an external file, the browser's `back' button
    will bring the user back to the last section visited in the file.

  + If one faces the internal histories end using `b' and `B', he may now go
    back/forward in the browsers history by repeatedly pressing `b' and `B'
    respectively.

* 2009-04-22

  + Choose the human-readable IDs for links by regexp again.
  + Fix the `g' command.
  + Fix: still support old section IDs.

* 2009-04-21 - Org-mode 6.26

  + New way to detect the IDs for sections. The script does not search for '#sec-'
    anymore. Instead, the new human readable IDs are used as well.

    To not break the old human readable IDs in anchors inside of headlines, those
    are still prefered.

  + org-info.js is now minified without obfuscation. This decreases the filesize
    by about 40%.

* 2009-03-04 Mi

  + Fixed title. Title was not displayed in info-view-mode.
  + Title above is now optiona. Append =\_title-above= to your view option, to
    always leave the title alone:
    =view:info\_title-above=

* 2009-03-03 Di

  Org-mode v. 6.23, commit a68eb4b1e64cbe6e495fdd2c1eaf8ae597bf8602, introduced
  a new <div> element around all the body's contents. You'll need at least the
  changes from today (org-info.js v. 0.1.0.1) from now on.

  org-info.js  v. 0.1.0.1 is backward compatible with elder versions of
  Org-modes export.

* 2009-02-01 So

  + Reuse the `ltoc' option for positioning the local toc. No local TOC stays
    the default. If a local TOC is shown, it's below the first text in a section
    by default. To display the local TOC above a sections text use

    : org_html_manager.set("LOCAL_TOC", "above");

* 2009-01-31 Sa

  + Fixed footnotes and back again.
  + You may now define, if the local TOC appears above or below the text of a
    section that preceeds the first subsection. Simply use something like this
    in the head of your HTML-files:

    : org_html_manager.set("LTOC_BEFORE_TEXT", "0");

    If not set, the local TOC is placed directly beneeth the section's
    headline. The default is to place the local TOC beneeth the text.

  + FIX: Avoid footnote-ref IDs in links to named sections.

* 2008-12-15 Mo

  + FIX: if non existent `#target', show the first section.
  + FIX: finaly make named anchors work.

* 2008-12-14 So

  Look for the id attribute for anchors to make named anchors work in XHTML.

* 2008-12-10 Mi

  + Default for links created by the Script (`l' and `L') now use the first
    named target for section if any. I.e. use =some.html#named= instead of
    =some.html#sec-3.1.2= where ever possible. This was a suggestion of Carsten
    Dominik.

* 2008-12-09 Di

  + FIXED: named internal links in local TOC.
  + FIXED: internal links were not working.

* 2008-11-11 Di

  + Footnotes working. It's a bit durty but works.
    Org-mode 6.12a required.

* 2008-09-06 Sa

  + *Toggle list items automatically* ::
    No need to create several sections with redundant content. Now the script
    handles exactly one plain list per section (the first one found)
    specially. The list items are displayed one by one.
  + *Documentation* ::
    Fixed some errors there and added a seperate section for presentation.

* 2008-08-27 Mi

  + *Slides* ::
    Move back and forth by double click and click.

* 2008-08-25 Mo

  + *Footnotes now working* ::
    Now =convertLinks()= converts footnote links too.

* 2008-08-24 So

  + *Wrap text before first headline in <p>* ::
    If you use org-info.js, the text before first headline is now wrapped into
    a =p= element:
    :<p id="text-before-first-headline"> text </p>
  + *Tag index* ::
    =C= now shows an index based on tags. This was an [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2008-07/msg00434.html][idea of Rick Moynihan]].
  + *Fixed appearance of 'HELP' link et al* ::
    I.e. added href attribute instead of onclick.

* 2008-08-03 So

  + *Next and previous sibling* ::
    Shortcuts: '=N=' and '=P='.

* 2008-07-27 So

  + Close the minibuffer, when reading ::
    do this, when a link ('next'...) is clicked.
  + Close help screen on ANY key press ::
    ...not only if a printable key was pressed.

* 2008-07-25 Fr

  + Broken links for 'l' and 'L' ::
    Thank's again to Carsten for reporting.
  + Startup help is now optional ::
    We have a little 'HELP' link now to click on.

* 2008-07-23 Mi

  + Any key to proceed ::
    Now it's realy any key that shuts down the minibuffer.
  + More hardcoded styles ::
    ...to avoid a border around the input field in the minibuffer and too much
    padding in the minibuffers =<td>= elements.

  + Divide the script in sections ::
    The script is now roughly devided in sections by form-feeds. Thus we can
    move section wise using the common emacs commands for this purpos ('=M-x
    ]=' and  '=M-x ]='). This was done to ease editing of the script.

    The sections are:
      1. The comment block on top of the file.
      2. Everything around =OrgNodes=.
      3. =org_html_manager= constructor and setup.
      4. =org_html_manager= folding and view related stuff.
      5. =org_html_manager= history related methods.
      6. =org_html_manager= minibuffer handling.
      7. =org_html_manager= user input.
      8. =org_html_manager= search functonality.
      9. =org_html_manager= misc.
      10. Global functions.

* 2008-07-09 Mi

  + Missing shortcuts in help ::
    '=F=' and '=B='.
  + Use two lines to be more verbose ::
    Since the new read-mode, there are many occasions when you have to press RET
    to close the minibuffer. Thus we should always have a parenthesis saying
    '/press X to close/'.
  + Implement the 'standard minibuffer' ::
    A little bit more visible, two lines, a narrow gray border.
  + Scroll to the very top for sec. 0 in plain view mode ::
    Scrolling the NODE.div into view seemed unnatural.
  + Standard height for minibuffer ::
    This was done to hide and show the minibuffer quite correct.
  + Reduce flicker after reading ::
    =hideConsole()= is only called, if the result of the last read command does
    not lead to an error. =showConsole()= looks, wether the the minibuffer is
    hidden.

* 2008-06-26 Do

  + Stop searching empty strings.
  + Use the local stylesheet again.
  + Show a startup message ::
    One out of many ideas from Carsten. This one is cutomizable. Use
    =org_html_manager.set("STARTUP_MESSAGE", "0");= to inhibit.

* 2008-06-24 Di

  + '=L=' and '=l=' use the new read mode ::
    This means we may use =CTRL-c= to copy the link. Close the minibuffer
    using =RET=.
  + '=L=' and '=l=' choose link type ::
    If the search string is not empty, the visitor is prompted to choose
    between a link to the current section or an 'occur' link.
  + Error in docs ::
    :Carsten Dominik schrieb:
    :> One more:
    :>
    :> index.html still says that "l" shows the list of shortcuts.  This is no
    :> longer the case.
    :>
    :> - Carsten
  + Absolute path to stylesheet ::
    Avoid missing stylesheet. Now this file links to the absolute URL.
  + RET hides minibuffer ::
    ...in every case now.
  + 's RET' does the same as 'S' ::
    One of the many good ideas of Carsten. \\
    Implementation: if the search string has not changed, '=s=' and '=r=' move on
    to the next/previous section. Else the current section is searched first.
  + Clear the search highlight ::
    If a new search/occur is started, the search highlight is cleared. It may
    still be cleared by pressing '=c=' (clear).
  + CSS styles renamed ::
    All the style classes and IDs in use are renamed, to avoid clashing with
    styles in other packages in Worg.git/code/*. All the styles are now
    prefixed by =org-info-js_= (see [[CSS]]).

* 2008-06-23 Mo

  + Position of minibuffer ::
    Typo. Fixed.
  + Remove nested search highlight ::
    If searching for /org/ and after that for /rg/, the highlight was not
    removed when pressing '=c=' (clear search highlight). Fixed.
  + Build regexp from user input ::
    To be able to search for e.g. '>' and '<' these characters are replaced with
    '=&gt;=' and '=&lt;=' respectively. It's now possible to search for the
    following characters:
    :< > \ = ? * +
    This is still a compromise since syntax highlighting is done using html
    tags. Thus searching for '=<script=' will not work for passages wehre the
    angle bracket has a different color than the word '=script='.
  + Occur mode ::
    Press '=o=' to get prompted for a string to search. The document switches
    to plain view mode and opens all sections containing the search
    string. Matches will be highlighted. Neither connected to the navigation
    history nor any special navigation so far. But you may walk through all
    the occurences using '=S=' and '=R='.
  + URL suffix for occur ::
    See section Section [[*Linking to Files using the Script]] for an example.
  + Shortcut table ::
    Thanks to Carsten Dominik for the great org radio table trick and the new
    shortcut table.

* 2008-06-22 So

  This update introduced some changes concerning keyboard shortcuts.

  *This one is not tested in IE yet!*

  + Search ::
    You may use '=s=' to search forward and '=r=' to search
    backwards. These two prompt for input. To repeat the last search, use
    '=S=' and '=R=' to search forward and backwards respectively.
    Use '=c=' to remove all the match highlights.

    Absolutely Beta...

  + goto-section ::
    Since '=s=' was the candidate for searching, it could no longer be used
    for the /goto section/ command. This is now remapped to '=g=' (goto).
  + No more popups ::
    The minibuffer can be switched to read mode. Thus it may be used to read
    input. No need for popup windows (=window.prompt()=) anymore.

* 2008-06-17 Di

  + New Variable org-export-section-number-format ::
    Adjusted the script to detect the IDs correctly for use with the new
    OrgMode version 6.05 (the section number format can now be adjusted in
    OrgMode via =org-export-section-number-format=). This Change is backward
    compatible.
  + Display HTML links ::
    '=l=' now displays a HTML link to the current section whereas '=L=' now
    shows the OrgMode link. Thanks to Carsten for this idea.

* 2008-05-23 Fr

  + *T.O.C. fixed accidentally*
  + Jump to link in sidebar ::

    If =FIXED\_TOC= is set, '=i=' focusses the first link in the T.O.C. =TAB=
    may be used to traverse the links.

* 2008-05-18 So

  + Docs where wrong ::
    Still some outdated stuff here.
  + Allow overwrites ::
    Changed the code to explicitly allow a certain URL overwrite. Otherwise
    visitors could overwrite any variable internally used by the
    =org_html_manger=.

* 2008-05-18 So

  + URL Parsing ::
    Now the user may call the script and pass options to overwrite the authors
    settings using this syntax:
    : http://localhost/index.html?TOC=0&VIEW=showall&MOUSE_HINT=rgb(255,133,0)
    Some links for testing are provided in section [[Linking to Files using the Script]]

  + Focus the T.O.C. ::
    '=i=' tries to focus the T.O.C. if =FIXED_TOC= is ="1"=. This is still
    very primitive. Just the first step. '=i=' simply focusses the first
    anchor in the T.O.C. Tabindexes empower the user to run through the links
    in the table of contents using the TAB key.

  + FIX: Show Start Section ::
    The start section (index.html#sec-X.Y) was not shown in plain view
    mode. Now this section is always shown regardless of initial folding state
    and view mode.

  + FIX: Hitting '=u=' several times ::
    Hitting '=u=' multiple times made the script focus the root node so that
    '=n=' went to the first section. Fixed.

  + IE and onclick ::
    Trying a different technique to make IE handle the clicks on
    headlines. Can't test this now in IE but don't want to forget the trick :)

*  2008-05-16 Fr

   + Org Links ::
     '=l=' prints an Org link in the minibuffer for copying to an org
     file. Currently it's only possible to copy the link using the mouse. A
     change of this is on my TODO list.

* 2008-05-12 Mo

  + *New key to go to the first section* ::
    Since '=i=' now shows the T.O.C. there was a shortcut missing to go to the
    first section (which might as well be the T.O.C. if =#+INFOJS_OPT:
    toc:t=). This key is now '=t=' or '=<='. For toggling the view mode, '=m=' is used
    from now on.
  + *New key for last section* ::
    '=E=' or '=>=' move to the last section.
  + *&iquest;* ::
    To show the help screen one may use the '=¿=' key. The help-screen got
    upated using '=&iquest;=' now to avoid distorted displaying of this
    character.
  + *org-info-info-navigation* ::
    Style class for the navigation bar in info view mode.
  + *Documentation* ::
    Documentation reworked. Should be fairly uptodate now.

* 2008-05-12 Mo

  + *Removal of Minibuffer* ::
    The minibuffer was not removed when unsing the mouse to navigate. Fixed.

* 2008-05-09 Fr

  + *First Section* ::
    '=n=' now unfolds the current section if folded when in plain view
    mode. Thus the first section will be shown after startup in folded view.
  + *Startup in info view mode* ::
    This one was broken. Fixed.

* 2008-05-04 So

  + *OrgHtmlManager class* ::
    No more OrgHtmlManager class anymore. Script uses the
    :var org_html_manager = { property: value, /* ... */ };
    syntax now. This was done to avoid inheritance and instantiation of more
    than one OrgHtmlManager.

  + *Help display* ::
    The displaying of Keyboard shortcuts now behaves like the (hidden)
    TOC. I.e. keyboard shortcuts are displayed when pressing '=?=' and any
    hidden again when pressing any key. The old view mode is restored when
    hiding the help display.

  + *Fixed: external links* ::
    External links now work again.

* 2008-05-02 Fr

  + *Minibuffer Handling* ::
    If the document is neither in info view mode nor displayed with a fixed
    TOC, the minibuffer will be shown right above the current headline. This
    is not the final fix for this, but a work around for the wrong IE
    behaviout concerning /position:fixed/.

  + *Keyboard Input on keypress* ::
    The script now takes the =onkeypress= function to read user input. This is
    more compatible then =onkeydown= or =onkeyup=. Thus the keys work now in
    IE too (and the '?' key in Firefox). Holding the '=n=' key down for a
    while can be used for fast searching.

  + *Scrolling in IE* ::
    ...is fixed. But it is not possible to scroll in IE if =FIXED_TOC= is on.

* 2008-04-17 Do

  + *RUNS DROPPED* ::
    The option '=RUNS=' is dropped now. The =org_html_manager= now tries to
    scan the document until it's entirely loaded. There is an internal limit
    now set to some hundred runs which will makes a max. ~2 minute scan
    phase.

* 2008-04-15 Di

  These two changes where ideas of Carsten Dominik.

  + *Local TOC* ::
    ...shows now subsections only.
  + *Cut the TOC* ::
    Now the table of contents may be cutted to a certain depth. Navigation is
    not affected. The name of the new =set()= option is '=TOC\_DEPTH='.

* 2008-04-13 So

  + *Overall history* ::
    History now records all commands that change the current section.
  + *Hide TOC but show when 'i' is pressed* ::
    The TOC is now always shown, when '=i=' is pressed, even if hidden from
    the document. The fun is, that each following navigation command triggers
    a history-back event. This way the hidden TOC does not show up when moving
    in the history thereafter. Hence now it's possible to read section 5.1,
    take a short look in the TOC and the next '=n=', '=p=' or '=b=' command
    takes you back to the section last visited (5.1 in this case).

* 2008-04-09 Mi

  - *Minibuffer fixed for IE* ::
    It now appears and hides again. Thanks to Tobias Prinz for the trick with
    negative margins.

* 2008-04-06 So

  + *Adjusted to new Setup*
    Carsten Dominik added the new possibility to configure the script using
    typical org syntax. Users may even use customize to set up the script
    now. Names of options passed to the =set()= functions are now adjusted to
    the ones we discussed. Internal variable names where changed to reflect
    this change.

    * TODO search my mails to figure out the correct date!!!


* 2008-03-31 Mo

  + *Fixed subindexes* ::
    ...when using =HIDE\_TOC=. First section had no subindex in this case.
  + *Added key q* ::
    ...to close the window.

* << 2008-03-30 So >>

  + Internal links working ::
    Internal links are now converted to work with this script. The user has
    to go back using the `=s=' key since the history is not
    updated. Could Browsers understand this? Or is there a possibility to
    catch the `/back/' button event?
  + org-file.html#sec-x.y.z ::
    is now working too. That is, http://path/to/org-file.html#sec-x.y.z makes
    the script displaying that section in the configured view mode.

  + Folding now on by default. ::

  + Scrolling ::
    '=v=' and '=V=' now scroll the window by the visible height of the
    document window. A little bit less though for better orientation.

  + Deleted setup section using export options template ::
    This one was not working. I'm not shure it ever was... but I think so. I
    should look up this one in the documentation again.

  + Plain view mode is default ::

  + FIXED Bugs ::
    - The view mode was dependend on the folding feature.
    - When folding was of an error was shown when trying to fold.

* << 2008-03-23 So>>

  + Clicking a headline makes it the current section ::
    and thus the candidate for displaying in next info view and the point
    from where 'next' and 'previous' work.

* << 2008-03-22 Sa >>

  + TOC, title and global folding ::
    The title was doubled in some cases. This should be fixed now. The TOC
    is now a node as all the other sections to.

  + Keyboard ::
    Some more work on this. There seems to be some locale related problem
    concerning the keyboard input of a `?´ (help) in Firefox. Added a
    workaround for this one, but probably only working here.

  + *Documentation updated.*

  + Stylesheet ::
    now with indentation. This demonstrates the folding somewhat better.

  + Hide T.O.C. ::
    The table of contents can now be hidden completely due to the new option
    =HIDE_TOC=. Hence the documents have to be exported with T.O.C., but may
    be displayed without it.

* << 2008-03-21 Fr >>

  + Commands reworked ::
    The '/minibuffer/' is now invisible by default. Commands can be entered
    into the =document= itself. Still, the chars entered are appended to the
    minibuffers contents, to keep the possibility to enter more complex
    commands in the future. The minibuffer is still needed for commands to
    work in firefox.

  + Section numbers are now read through =window.prompt()= ::
    This was done to simplify the command interface code. Now the commands
    entered are just one char in length.

  + Global folding now working ::
    There was not much to do left for this one to do.

* << 2008-03-13 Do >>

  *Added new config options:*

  + LINK\_UP ::
    May be set, to link to an other file, preferably the main index page. This
    link will be displayed as
    :<a href="LINK_UP">HOME</a>
    Command: '=h=' - home
  + LINK\_TO\_MAIN ::
    May be set, to link to an other file, preferably the main index page. This
    link will be displayed as
    :<a href="LINK_TO_MAIN">Up</a>
    Command: '=H=' - HOME

    This way we can link files into a tree, if all subdirectories in the
    project follow the same conventions. Like containing some
    =subdir/index.org= and a homepage somwhere else.

* << 2008-03-12 Mi >>

  + Folding. ::
    First attempt to get the global folding working. Hmm.

  + Radical code cleanup. ::
    Removed unused variables and functions. More secure, less
    errorprone. This cood be even better.
  + *Org mode like toggling of headlines now basically works.*
  + Commands can be input through a little 'minibuffer' on top of the screen. ::
    This needs some special style settings for IE (position fixed). I will
    append a minimal stylesheet for this purpos the next days in this
    documentation for copy and paste.
    This is partially working. Implemented Commands are:
    - '=help=' - show a little help screen. This done with =alert()= and
      thus a TODO.
    - '=t=' - toggle view mode.
    - '=k=' - kill the /minibuffer/.
    - '=N=' - where =N= is a section number: goto section =N=. This could be
      working in both modes very easy, but currently also only in info view
      mode implemented.
  + *Code relies now on next generation XHTML-Export format.*
  + Some kind of rudimentary debugging system. ::
    May be turned on bei seting config options:
    :org_html_manager.set("WINDOW_BORDER", "true");
    :org_html_manager.set("DEBUG", org_html_manager.DEBUG_FATAL);
  + Better way of configuration for the enduser. Fault tolerant. No undefined ::
    variables when scanning starts. The users my use the =set(key, value)=
    function of the =OrgHtmlManger= class like this:
    :org_html_manager.set ( "LOCAL_TOC",        0);
    :org_html_manager.set ( "VIEW_BUTTONS", "true");
    :org_html_manager.set ( "FOLDING",            "true");
    :org_html_manager.set ( "MOUSE_HINT",         "underline");
    :org_html_manager.set ( "CONSOLE",            "true");
    :org_html_manager.setup ();
  + New configuration accepts these options ::
    - =SUB\_INDEXES= ::
      Create subindexes for sections containing sections.
    - =INFO\_SWITCH\_ALWAYS= ::
      Show the small '/toggle view/' link next to every Headline to toggle
      the view easily without scrolling back to top of the page in plain
      view mode.
    - =FOLDING= ::
      This is for the new folding. Turn it on. This will be the default when
      the moving and toggling has an acceptable form.
    - =MOUSE\_HINT= ::
      I love this one. Accepts the keyword '=underline=' or any other
      value. But if not '=underline=', it should be a valid value to set the
      =background-color= in CSS. So preferebly something like
      '=#eeeeee='. In plain view mode with toggle feature turned on the
      headline with mouse in it will be either hightlighted, if you pass a
      color, or underlined.
    - =CONSOLE= ::
      Display the /minibuffer/ on top of the screen. Turn this one on. It's
      fun and you can kill it simply by pressing '=k='.
    - =VIEW= ::
      Set the initial view mode. Set to =org\_html\_manager.PLAIN\_VIEW= or
      =org\_html\_manager.INFO\_VIEW=.
