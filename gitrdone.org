* GIT R DONE !
 	
http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=git+r+done

: The modern use of git r done was developed in the early 90's by hard
: working white males who reached a point in their life where they wanted
: to actually accomplish something in life... instead of getting
: completely hammered and rebuilding transmissions, the started doing
: projects that really mattered - projects like fixing the mailbox,
: cleaning the house, possibly even taking a few loads to the dump. This
: sudden surge of progress made these men feel good, like they were doing
: something. So, they had to have a way in their simple minds to reaffirm
: that feeling of getting something done. Thus, "GITRDONE!" was born. This
: can be said before a task is completed to motivate them, or after a task
: is completed to celebrate. It is also used profusely during the process
: of completing a task for no apparent reason which is very obnoxious and
: ambient. Often used with a drawn out "Woooooo!" yelling before or
: after. GITRDONE!

* A Day Unplugged: Frenzied Blackberries vs. Kwai Chang Caine?
  
http://www.43folders.com/2008/03/03/kung-fu-unplugged

: In yesterday's New York Times, Mark Bittman wrote an entertaining and
: thoughtful article about realizing that his need to stay wired,
: in-touch, and updated was really starting to eat into him. His headslap
: moment came on an international flight, as he realizes the only other
: place I could escape was in my sleep.  He goes on to talk about the
: difficulty of maintaining even a single day of Sabbath from electronic
: communication and media...

: The next time you're juggling options — which friend to see, which house to
: buy, which career to pursue — try asking yourself this question: What would
: Xiang Yu do?    
: 
: Xiang Yu was a Chinese general in the third century B.C. who took his troops
: across the Yangtze River into enemy territory and performed an experiment in
: decision making. He crushed his troops' cooking pots and burned their ships.
: 
: He explained this was to focus them on moving forward — a motivational speech
: that was not appreciated by many of the soldiers watching their retreat option
: go up in flames. But General Xiang Yu would be vindicated, both on the
: battlefield and in the annals of social science research.
