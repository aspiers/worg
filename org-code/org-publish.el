;;; Commentary:

;; Requires at least version 4.27 of org.el
;;
;; The official org-mode website:
;; http://staff.science.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/org/
;;
;; Home page for org-publish.el:
;; http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/OrgMode.html

;; This program extends the HTML publishing support of Emacs Org-mode
;; to allow configurable publishing of related sets of files as a
;; complete website.
;;
;; org-publish.el can do the following:
;;
;; + Publish all one's org-files to html
;; + Upload html, images, attachments and other files to a web server
;; + Exclude selected private pages from publishing
;; + Publish a clickable index of pages
;; + Manage local timestamps, for publishing only changed files
;; + Accept plugin functions to extend range of publishable content
;;
;; Special thanks to the org-mode maintainer Carsten Dominik for his
;; ideas, enthusiasm, and cooperation.

;;; Installation:

;; Put org-publish.el in your load path, byte-compile it, and then add
;; the following lines to your emacs initialization file:

;; (autoload 'org-publish "org-publish" nil t)
;; (autoload 'org-publish "org-publish-all" nil t)
;; (autoload 'org-publish "org-publish-current-file" nil t)
;; (autoload 'org-publish "org-publish-current-project" nil t)

;; NOTE: When org-publish.el is included with org.el, those forms are
;; already in the file org-install.el, and hence don't need to be put
;; in your emacs initialization file in this case.

;;; Usage:
;;
;; The program's main configuration variable is
;; `org-publish-project-alist'. See below for example configurations
;; with commentary.

;; The main interactive functions are:
;;
;; M-x org-publish
;; M-x org-publish-all
;; M-x org-publish-current-file
;; M-x org-publish-current-project

;;;; Simple example configuration:

;; (setq org-publish-project-alist
;;       (list
;;        '("org" . (:base-directory "~/org/"
;; 		     :base-extension "org"
;; 		     :publishing-directory "~/public_html"
;;                   :with-section-numbers nil
;; 		     :table-of-contents nil
;; 		     :style "<link rel=stylesheet href=\"../other/mystyle.css\" type=\"text/css\">")))

;;;; More complex example configuration:

;; Imagine your *.org files are kept in ~/org, your images in
;; ~/images, and stylesheets in ~/other. Now imagine you want to
;; publish the files through an ssh connection to a remote host, via
;; Tramp-mode. To maintain relative links from *.org files to /images
;; and /other, we should replicate the same directory structure in
;; your web server account's designated html root (in this case,
;; assumed to be ~/html)

;; Once you've done created the proper directories, you can adapt the
;; following example configuration to your specific paths, run M-x
;; org-publish-all, and it should publish the files to the correct
;; directories on the web server, transforming the *.org files into
;; HTML, and leaving other files alone.

;; (setq org-publish-project-alist
;;       (list
;;        '("orgfiles" :base-directory "~/org/"
;; 		       :base-extension "org"
;; 		       :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/notebook/"
;; 		       :publishing-function org-publish-org-to-html
;; 		       :exclude "PrivatePage.org"   ;; regexp
;; 		       :headline-levels 3
;;                     :with-section-numbers nil
;; 		       :table-of-contents nil
;; 		       :style "<link rel=stylesheet href=\"../other/mystyle.css\" type=\"text/css\">"
;; 		       :auto-preamble t
;; 		       :auto-postamble nil)
;;
;;         ("images" :base-directory "~/images/"
;; 	             :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png"
;; 		     :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/images/"
;; 		     :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)
;;
;;         ("other"  :base-directory "~/other/"
;; 	   	     :base-extension "css"
;; 		     :publishing-directory "/ssh:user@host:~/html/other/"
;; 		     :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)
;;         ("website" :components ("orgfiles" "images" "other"))))

;; For more information, see the documentation for the variable
;; `org-publish-project-alist'.

;; Of course, you don't have to publish to remote directories from
;; within emacs. You can always just publish to local folders, and
;; then use the synchronization/upload tool of your choice.

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl))


(defgroup org-publish nil
	"Options for publishing a set of Org-mode and related files."
   :tag "Org Publishing"
   :group 'org)


(defcustom org-publish-project-alist nil
  "Association list to control publishing behavior.
Each element of the alist is a publishing 'project.'  The CAR of
each element is a string, uniquely identifying the project. The
CDR of each element is in one of the following forms:

  (:property value :property value ... )

OR,

  (:components (\"project-1\" \"project-2\" ...))

When the CDR of an element of org-publish-project-alist is in
this second form, the elements of the list after :components are
taken to be components of the project, which group together files
requiring different publishing options. When you publish such a
project with M-x org-publish, the components all publish.

When a property is given a value in org-publish-project-alist, its
setting overrides the value of the corresponding user variable
 (if any) during publishing. However, options set within a file
override everything.

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set:

    :base-directory        Directory containing publishing source files
    :base-extension        Extension (without the dot!) of source files.
                             This can be a regular expression.
    :publishing-directory  Directory (possibly remote) where output
                             files will be published

The :exclude property may be used to prevent certain files from
being published. Its value may be a string or regexp matching
file names you don't want to be published.

The :include property may be used to include extra files. Its
value may be a list of filenames to include. The filenames are
considered relative to the publishing directory.

When both :include and :exclude properties are given values, the
exclusion step happens first.

One special property controls which back-end function to use for
publishing files in the project. This can be used to extend the
set of file types publishable by org-publish, as well as the set
of output formats.

    :publishing-function     Function to publish file. The default is
                             org-publish-org-to-html, but other
                             values are possible. May also be a
                             list of functions, in which case 
                             each function in the list is invoked
                             in turn.

Another property allows you to insert code that prepares a
project for publishing. For example, you could call GNU Make on a
certain makefile, to ensure published files are built up to date. 

    :preparation-function   Function to be called before publishing
                              this project.

Some properties control details of the Org publishing process,
and are equivalent to the corresponding user variables listed in
the right column. See the documentation for those variables to
learn more about their use and default values.

    :author                user-full-name
    :email                 user-mail-address

The following properties may be used to control publishing of an
index of files or summary page for a given project.

    :auto-index            Whether to publish an index during
                           org-publish-current-project or org-publish-all.
    :index-filename        Filename for output of index. Defaults
                           to 'index.org' (which becomes 'index.html')
    :index-title           Title of index page. Defaults to name of file.
    :index-function        Plugin function to use for generation of index.
                           Defaults to 'org-publish-org-index', which
                           generates a plain list of links to all files
                           in the project.
