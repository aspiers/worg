;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The Org mode already lets you store/insert links to BibTeX entries.
;;
;; But what if you want to insert the author or the title of a BibTeX
;; item in a *remember* buffer?  This library lets you deal with this 
;; by adding more properties to the BibTeX link.
;;
;; The available properties for each entry are listed here:
;;
;; :author        :publisher      :volume      :pages
;; :editor        :url            :number      :journal
;; :title         :year           :series      :address
;; :booktitle     :month          :annote      :abstract
;; :key           :btype          :keywords
;; 
;; Here is an example of a remember template that use some of this
;; information (:author :year :title :journal :pages):
;; 
;; (setq org-remember-templates 
;;   '((?b "* READ %?\n\n%a\n\n%:author (%:year): %:title\n   \
;;          In %:journal, %:pages.")))
;; 
;; Let's say you want to remember this BibTeX entry:
;; 
;; @Article{dolev83,
;;   author = 	 {Danny Dolev and Andrew C. Yao},
;;   title = 	 {On the security of public-key protocols},
;;   journal = 	 {IEEE Transaction on Information Theory},
;;   year = 	 1983,
;;   volume =	 2,
;;   number =	 29,
;;   pages =	 {198--208},
;;   month =	 {Mars}
;; }
;; 
;; M-x `org-remember' on this entry will produce this buffer:
;; 
;; =====================================================================
;; * READ <== [point here]
;; 
;; [[file:/file.bib::dolev83][Dolev & Yao 1983: security of public key protocols]]
;; 
;; Danny Dolev and Andrew C. Yao (1983): On the security of public-key protocols
;; In IEEE Transaction on Information Theory, 198--208.
