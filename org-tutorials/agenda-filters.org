* Introduction

This tutorial describes some useful agenda manipulations.

The central notions are /filters/ and /limits/.  Filters are a way to
/hide/ some agenda entries (depending on tags, categories or regular
expressions).  /Limits/ are a way to limit the list of agenda entries
(depending on a number of tagged entries, a number of entries with =TODO=
keywords, an effort value, or a number of entries.)

Filters only act on the /appearence/ of the agenda, limits act on the list
of agenda entries itself.

* Agenda filters
#+index: filtering, in agenda

** Filtering by tags
#+index: filtering, by tag

Here is a list of keybinding available in the agenda buffer:

- =/= :: Only show entries matching a tag.  This prompts for a tag to
     filter by, which you can choose by hitting a selection letter (if
     configured), or the first letter of the tag, or by hitting =TAB= and
     then expand a tag.

- =C-u /= :: Hide entries matching a tag.  You can successively call this
     command to hide several tags.

- =/ /= :: Reset tag filters: set tag filters to their default value, which
     is usually =nil=, unless a tag filter has been preset.

** Filtering by category
#+index: filtering, by category


- =<= :: Only show agenda entries that are from the same category than the
     headline at point.  Hitting =<= again when a category filter is active
     will deactivate it.  This kind of filtering is /not/ cumulative, as
     headlines cannot have several categories.

- =C-u <= :: Hide agenda entries that are from the same category than the
     headline at point.

** Filtering by top parent headline
#+index: filtering, by top parent headline


- =^= :: Only show siblings of the agenda entry at point.  This is useful
     when there are many agenda entries and you want to process siblings in
     priority.  Hitting =^= again when a top headline filter is active will
     deactivate it.  This kind of filtering is /not/ cumulative, as
     headlines cannot have several topmost parents.

** Filtering by regular expressions
#+index: filtering, by regular expressions

- ~=~ :: Prompt for a regular expression and only show agenda entries that
     match match the regular expression.  You can successively filter by
     regexps.

- =C-u == :: Filter out entries that match a regexp.  You can successively
     filter out by regexps.

- =C-u C-u == :: Remove all regexps filters.

** Combining and removing filters
#+index: filters, combining
#+index: filters, removing

You can filter by tags, then by regexps, than by category, then by topmost
parent -- in *any* order.

To remove all filters from the current agenda view, hit =|=.

** COMMENT TODO Pre-filtering

* Agenda limits
#+index: limits, in agenda
#+index: org-agenda-max-entries
#+index: org-agenda-max-effort 
#+index: org-agenda-max-todos
#+index: org-agenda-max-tags

Here is a list of options that you can set, either globally, or locally in
your custom agenda:

- =org-agenda-max-entries= :: Limit the number of entries.
- =org-agenda-max-effort= :: Limit the duration of accumulated efforts (as minutes).
- =org-agenda-max-todos= :: Limit the number of entries with TODO keywords.
- =org-agenda-max-tags= :: Limit the number of tagged entries.

When set to a positive integer, each option will exclude entries from other
catogories: for example, =(setq org-agenda-max-effort 100)= will limit the
agenda to 100 minutes of effort and exclude any entry that as no effort
property.  If you want to include entries with no effort property, use a
negative value for =org-agenda-max-effort=.

One useful setup is to use =org-agenda-max-entries= locally in a custom
command.  For example, this custom command will display the next five
entries with a =NEXT= TODO keyword.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("n" todo "NEXT"
         ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)))))
#+END_SRC

Once you mark one of these five entry as =DONE=, rebuilding the agenda will
again the next five entries again, including the first entry that was
excluded so far.

You can also dynamically set temporary limits by pressing =~= (or =M-x
org-agenda-limit-interactively RET=).  Those temporary limits are lost when
rebuilding the agenda.

* Dimming blocked task

#+INDEX: dimming blocked tasks in agenda
#+INDEX: blocked tasks, dimming in agenda

Blocked tasks are dimmed by default in the agenda.

You can turn this feature off with this in your =.emacs.el= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks nil)
#+END_SRC

This will actually speed up the agenda generation (see [[file:../agenda-optimization.org][the Worg page on
Agenda optimization]]).

Then, if you want to turn this feature on temporarily for the current
agenda, just enter =M-x org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks RET= interactively.
