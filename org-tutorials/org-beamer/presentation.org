* Introduction
** Overview
- org-mode template
- beamer structure
- beamer settings


* Methodology

** A simple slide
This slide consists of some text with a number of bullet points:
- the first, very @important@, point!
- the previous point shows the use of the special markup which
  translates to the Beamer specific /alert/ command for highlighting
  text.
The above list could be numbered or any other type of list and may
include sub-lists.

** A more complex slide
This slide illustrates the use of Beamer blocks.  The following text,
with its own headline, is displayed in a block:
*** Org mode increases productivity				  :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
    - org mode means not having to remember \LaTeX commands.
    - it is based on ascii text which is inherently portable.
    - Emacs!

    \hfill \(\qed\)

** Two columns

*** A block					      :B_ignoreheading:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: ignoreheading
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
    - this slide consists of two columns
    - the first (left) column has no heading and consists of text
    - the second (right) column has an image and is enclosed in an
      @example@ block

*** A screenshot 					    :BMCOL:B_example:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.6
    :BEAMER_env: example
    :END:

* Conclusions

** Summary
   - org is an incredible tool for time management
   - @but@ it is also excellent for writing and for preparing presentations
   - Beamer is a very powerful \LaTeX{} package for presentations
   - the combination is unbeatable!

* Problems

** Some problems
   - the =verbatim= markup doesn't seem to export properly.
