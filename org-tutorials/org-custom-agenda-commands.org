Org-mode's built-in agenda commands are powerful tools for searching
your notes and for gathering, sorting, filtering, and displaying your
tasks. As you become familiar with the power of the agenda commands,
you may want to:

- create shortcuts for frequent agenda searches (e.g., a search for
  all TODOs with the tag "@computer").
- combine different different searches into a single [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Block-agenda.html#Block-agenda][block agenda]].
  (e.g., a daily agenda plus all TODO items with the tag "@work" and
  the tag "@computer").
- change the query and display options for specific agenda searches
  (sorting, appearance, files used, etc.).
- set up automatic export of custom agenda views to a variety of
  formats (html, ps, txt).
- call user-defined functions from the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-dispatcher.html#Agenda-dispatcher][agenda dispatcher]].

All of these things can be accomplished with the variable
org-agenda-custom-commands.

* How to create custom agenda commands 

The [[http://orgmode.org/manual/index.html][org-mode manual]] provides a [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Custom-agenda-views.html#Custom-agenda-views][comprehensive explanation]] of custom
agenda commands. This tutorial is meant to supplement the manual by
exploring some of the uses and benefits of such customization.

If you have not previously created a custom agenda command, the
easiest way to get started is to type:

: M-x customize-variable RET org-agenda-custom-commands

The customization buffer for the variable provides a nice interface
for setting custom commands as well as a full explanation of the
different components of the setting.

As the documentation explains, the configuration for each custom
command is a list consisting of the following:

- 1) Key :: The shortcut for invoking the command in the agenda
            dispatcher ("h", "J", etc.).
- 2) Description (optional) :: The description of the command that
                    will be displayed in the agenda dispatcher
                    (optional).
- 3) Type of search :: The desired agenda display/search. The options
     include agenda, todo, search, tags, alltodo, tags-todo,
     todo-tree, tags-tree, occur-tree, or a user-defined function.
- 4) Search term :: Depending on the type of search, this will be a
                    TODO keyword, a tag (or property), a word, or a
                    regular expression.
- 5) Settings (optional) :: How the agenda command should search and
     display information. These are local settings, active only for
     the command in which they are set.
- 6) Export files (optional) :: If you want the agenda view to be
     automatically exported when you type C-c a e, then you can
     include the path to the exported file here. The file extension
     will determine the export format.
     
** Sample customization
   
Here is a sample custom agenda command as one might set it in an
.emacs file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands 
      '(("c" "Desk Work" tags-todo "computer" ;; (1) (2) (3) (4)
	 ((org-agenda-files '("~/org/widgets.org" "~/org/clients.org")) ;; (5)
	  (org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-up effort-down))) ;; (5) cont.
	 ("~/computer.html")) ;; (6)
	;; ...other commands here
	))
#+END_SRC
	 
The first line in this custom command contains: 

1. the key to trigger the search ("c")
2. a description of the search for the agenda dispatcher ("Desk Work")
3. the type of search (todo items matching a tag)
4. the tag to search for ("computer")

The next two lines (5) set local options for this agenda command only.
Any options you set here will not interfere with your global agenda
settings. In this particular command, the files widgets.org and
clients.org will be searched and the agenda display will sort the
todos first by priority (highest priority last), then by estimated
effort (highest effort first)---regardless or your global
org-agenda-sorting-strategy.

The last line (6) specifies that this agenda view should be exported
as HTML to "~/computer.html" when the agenda export function is called
(C-c a e).

And here is what the setting above looks like in an emacs
customization buffer:

[[file:../images/mdl/org-custom-agenda-commands-1.png]]

Of course, you need not include all of these components in every
custom command. A more minimalistic set of instructions might look
like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("w" todo "STARTED") ;; (1) (3) (4)
	;; ...other commands here
	))
#+END_SRC

This will produce a list of all tasks with the todo keyword
STARTED.[1]

[1] If you omit a description the agenda dispatcher will simply show
the search type and search string in place of a description.

In addition to agenda views, custom agenda commands can also be used
to store commonly used searches, such as sparse trees and occur trees.
See the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Sparse-trees.html#Sparse-trees][manual's section on sparse trees]] for further information.

As the examples above illustrate, agenda commands can range from
simple stored searches to elaborate agenda views that diverge
substantially from your normal agenda settings (different agenda
files, different sorting strategies, different display options, etc.).

Now, let's look at a few usage scenarios.

* A use scenario: block agenda views

Perhaps the most common use of custom commands is to save the results
of frequent agenda searches and (optionally) to combine multiple
searches together in a single view.

Let's imagine you've just settled in at your office desk in the
morning, ready for a good day's labor. You want to review your work
before you get started. As part of your typical routine, you'd like to
see:

1. your scheduled tasks and upcoming deadlines
2. any urgent tasks with the priority "A"
3. any tasks you can do at your computer or in your office or on the
   phone
4. any headlines tagged "project" for which CATEGORY="elephants"
5. any headlines tagged "review" in the file "circuspeanuts.org"
6. any items that have the todo keyword "WAITING"

You could do a number of agenda searches by hand, first calling the
agenda, then the tag-todo search (twice), then a tag search, then a
tag search restricted to the file circuspeanuts.org, and finally the
todo keyword search. In other words:

: C-c a a
: C-c a M +PRIORITY="A"
: C-c a M computer|office|phone
: C-c a m project+CATEGORY="elephants"
: C-x b circuspeanuts.org
: C-c a < m review
: C-c a T WAITING

That would be a lot of manual labor before you had even begun your
work. You could make your life easier by combining these searches into
a single agenda command that compiles the results of all the searches:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("O" "Office block agenda"
	 ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-ndays 1))) 
	              ;; limits the agenda display to a single day
	  (tags-todo "+PRIORITY=\"A\"")
	  (tags-todo "computer|office|phone")
	  (tags "project+CATEGORY=\"elephants\"")
	  (tags "review" ((org-agenda-files '("~/org/circuspeanuts.org"))))
	                  ;; limits the tag search to the file circuspeanuts.org
	  (todo "WAITING"))
	 ((org-agenda-compact-blocks t))) ;; options set here apply to the entire block
        ;; ...other commands here
	))
#+END_SRC 
	
You'll notice that you can configure local settings for each of the
searches in a block agenda. This powerful option enables fine-grained
control of the agenda display. You could, for instance, create a block
agenda that displays all headlines tagged "office" in the file
"widgets.org", followed by all headlines tagged "computer" in the file
"clients.org", and so on.

** An example: GTD weekly review 
   
If you're into GTD, you can use org-agenda-custom-commands to create
block views for the weekly review, such as:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("W" "Weekly Review"
	 ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-ndays 7))) ;; review upcoming deadlines and appointments
	                                   ;; type "l" in the agenda to review logged items 
	  (stuck "") ;; review stuck projects as designated by org-stuck-projects
	  (todo "PROJECT") ;; review all projects (assuming you use todo keywords to designate projects)
	  (todo "MAYBE") ;; review someday/maybe items
	  (todo "WAITING"))) ;; review waiting items 
	 ;; ...other commands here
	))
#+END_SRC 

* Making the most of local settings
   
Agenda commands can be used for much more than managing workload. They
are also powerful ways to search and display notes in org files.

One use of custom agenda commands is to create different sets of
search options. Let's say, for instance, that you have three separate
directories of org-files:

  - "~/org/" for your project files
  - "~/website/" for your published files 
  - "~/archive/" for old projects and notes

Most of the time, you only want to search your project files, so you
set the global option appropriately:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-files (file-expand-wildcards "~/org/*.org"))
#+END_SRC

But there are no doubt times when you need to search your website or
your archive files. To make this possible, you could create the
following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("Q" . "Custom queries") ;; gives label to "Q" 
	("Qa" "Archive search" search ""
	 ((org-agenda-files (file-expand-wildcards "~/archive/*.org")))) 
	("Qw" "Website search" search ""
	 ((org-agenda-files (file-expand-wildcards "~/website/*.org"))))
	("Qb" "Projects and Archive" search ""
	 ((org-agenda-text-search-extra-files (file-expand-wildcards "~/archive/*.org"))))
	        ;; searches both projects and archive directories
	("QA" "Archive tags search" org-tags-view "" 
	 ((org-agenda-files (file-expand-wildcards "~/archive/*.org"))))
	;; ...other commands here
	 ))
#+END_SRC

Now you are only a key command away from searching different sets of
org files.

Note that the key triggers in the example above consist of two
characters. If you have numerous custom agenda commands, this is a
nice way to organize the agenda dispatcher into subpages. Only "Q"
will appear on the main dispatcher view, the commands themselves will
appear in a second view after you press "Q".

First view:

[[file:../images/mdl/org-custom-agenda-commands-2.png]]

Second view (after pressing "Q"):

[[file:../images/mdl/org-custom-agenda-commands-3.png]]

The possibilities for using local search settings are myriad. One
could, for instance, tweak display options for sparse tree searches
via the variables org-show-hierarchy-above and org-show-entry-below
(see [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Setting-Options.html#Setting-Options][this section of the manual]]). Or, as Carsten explained in [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/9984][this
mailing list post]], one can create custom agenda commands that default
to a column view:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("x" "With deadline columns" alltodo ""
	 ((org-agenda-overriding-columns-format "%20ITEM %DEADLINE")
	  (org-agenda-start-view-columns-initially t)))))
#+END_SRC

* Other configuration ideas

This section is for additional ideas for configuring
org-agenda-custom-commands. Feel free to add your own configurations
here.

** GTD contexts
   
Keyboard shortcuts to search by GTD contexts. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

      '(("g" . "GTD contexts")
	("go" "Office" tags-todo "office")
	("gc" "Computer" tags-todo "computer")
	("gp" "Phone" tags-todo "phone")
	("gh" "Home" tags-todo "home")
	("ge" "Errands" tags-todo "errands")
	("G" "GTD Block Agenda"
	 ((tags-todo "office")
	  (tags-todo "computer")
	  (tags-todo "phone")
	  (tags-todo "home")
	  (tags-todo "errands"))
	 nil                      ;; i.e., no local settings
	 ("~/next-actions.html")) ;; exports block to this file with C-c a e
       ;; ..other commands here
	))
#+END_SRC
	
** Priorities 
   
Shortcuts to display tasks by priority level:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("p" . "Priorities")
	("pa" "A items" tags-todo "+PRIORITY=\"A\"")
	("pb" "B items" tags-todo "+PRIORITY=\"B\"")
	("pc" "C items" tags-todo "+PRIORITY=\"C\"")
        ;; ...other commands here
	))
#+END_SRC
