* Introduction
[[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] is an excellent tool for project planning as Peter Jones has
shown in his article on [[http://www.contextualdevelopment.com/articles/2008/project-planning][project planning]]. He first breaks the project
into features and tasks, then estimates the effort and from that
presents a project plan. In this tutorial we will take this one step
further, assign resources to the tasks, schedule the tasks and create
the corresponding gantt chart for this project.

We will be using [[http://www.taskjuggler.org/][TaskJuggler]] to handle the task scheduling, resource
leveling and creation of a myriad of charts (such as [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart][Gantt chart]]) for
your customer or your [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-haired_Boss][Pointy-haired Boss]].

* Plan your project
You start out as you normally would by breaking down the project into
tasks. Let's take the following example where you have a project to
create an accounting software:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Accounting Software

,** Specification

,** Software Development
,*** Database coupling
,*** Back-End Functions
,*** Graphical User Interface

,** Software testing
,*** Alpha Test
,*** Beta Test

,** Manual

,** Milestones
,*** Project start
,*** Technology Preview
,*** Beta version
,*** Ship Product to Customer
#+END_SRC

* Estimate the effort
Now that you've figured out the tasks it's time to estimate the
efforts for each task. By using column view this can be done very
efficiently. It also helps to define the =COLUMNS= and default values
for the Effort property as shown in the following screen shot:

#+CAPTION: Estimating effort using column view 
#+ATTR_HTML: alt="Estimating effort using column view"
[[file:../images/taskjuggler/effort-estimation.png]]

Your resulting Org mode project file will look somewhat like the
following:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+PROPERTY: Effort_ALL 2d 5d 10d 20d 30d 35d 50d 
,#+COLUMNS: %70ITEM(Task) %Effort

,* Accounting Software

,** Specification
   :PROPERTIES:
   :Effort:   20d
   :END:

,** Software Development

,*** Database coupling
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Effort:   20d
    :END:

,*** Back-End Functions
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Effort:   30d
    :END:

   :PROPERTIES:
   :Effort:   50d
   :END:

,** Milestones

,*** Technology Preview
,*** Beta version
,*** Ship Product to Customer
#+END_SRC

* Generate a Gantt chart
Before you now export the project to TaskJuggler you need to tell the
exporter in which tree it can find the tasks. You do this by adding
the tag ~taskjuggler_project~ to the node "Accounting Software"[fn:1].
Do this by moving to the "Accounting Software" headline and typing the
following:

: C-c C-c taskjuggler_project RET

This allows you to have other nodes for this project such as an
introduction or general notes.

To export the project to TaskJuggler you simply type 

: M-x org-export-as-taskjuggler-and-open

This will open your project in TaskJugglerUI as illustrated below

#+CAPTION: Gantt chart in TaskJugglerUI
#+ATTR_HTML: alt="Gantt chart in TaskJugglerUI"
[[file:../images/taskjuggler/TaskJugglerUI1.png]]

Since we have not assigned any resources to work on the project the
exporter assumes that you will be the one working on it and has
assigned all tasks to you. The tasks have been serialized so that you
will not have to many things to do at once, i.e. the resources will be
leveled.

* Assign resources
The next step is to list all the resources working on the project and
assign the tasks to them. Create a node for the resources. You can
group the resources by creating hierarchies. Tag the resource tree
with the tag ~taskjuggler_resource~ so that the exporter knows where to
look for resource definitions[fn:2].

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* Resources                                         :taskjuggler_resource:
,** Developers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :resource_id: dev
   :END:
,*** Paul Smith
    :PROPERTIES:
    :resource_id: paul
    :END:
,*** Sébastien Bono
    :PROPERTIES:
    :resource_id: seb
    :END:
,*** Klaus Müller

,** Others
,*** Peter Murphy
    :PROPERTIES:
    :resource_id: doc
    :END:
,*** Dim Sung
    :PROPERTIES:
    :resource_id: test
    :END:
#+END_SRC

As you'll note I also added some ~resource_id~ properties to some of
the resources (or resource groups). I will use these identifiers to
allocate the resources to the tasks. The exporter will create unique
ids for the resources automatically[fn:3], but if you want to use
short forms it's better to define ~resource_id~ properties for your
resources. This will also allow you to define default values for the
allocation as follows:

: #+PROPERTY: allocate_ALL dev doc test

The easiest way to assign resources is again the column view mode.
There is no need to allocate a resource to every task, as allocations
are inherited in TaskJuggler[fn:4]. You'll note in the screen shot
below that some tasks have more than one resource assigned to them.
TaskJuggler will calculate the duration of the task based on the
effort and the resources working on this task.

#+CAPTION: Assign resources
#+ATTR_HTML: alt="Assign resources"
[[file:../images/taskjuggler/assign-resources.png]]

If we now export the project you'll see that TaskJuggler scheduled
some tasks in parallel (as there are several resources now which can
work in parallel). See the screen shot below:

#+CAPTION: Gantt Chart with multiple resources
#+ATTR_HTML: alt="Gantt Chart with multiple resources"
[[file:../images/taskjuggler/TaskJugglerUI2.png]]

Obviously we need to define dependencies between the tasks.

* Define dependencies
There are several ways to define dependencies between tasks. When
coming from an Org mode background you probably want to define them
using the facilities provided by Org mode, which are either 

  - The =ORDERED= property which allows you to state that the child
    tasks have to be completed in the order they appear (top most
    first).

  - The =BLOCKER= property which allows you to state that a task
    depends on either
    - a previous sibling ("previous-sibling") or 
    - any other task by stating the ~task_id~ property of the
      predecessor

Again, it is probably easiest to define the dependencies using the
column view as shown below in the screen shot:

#+CAPTION: Defining dependencies using column view 
#+ATTR_HTML: alt="Defining dependencies using column view"
[[file:../images/taskjuggler/define-dependencies.png]]

Lastly there is also the ~depends~ property which corresponds to the
TaskJuggler terminology. It can be used the same way as the =BLOCKER=
property. This is illustrated below where the "Software Development"
for example is blocked by the task "Specification", i.e. it has to
wait until the specification is done. The task "Software Development"
is defined as =ORDERED=, i.e. all the subtasks of it have to be
completed in sequence. Another example is the milestone "Ship Product
to Customer" which is waiting until the Beta test and the Manual are
done.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,#+PROPERTY: Effort_ALL 2d 5d 10d 20d 30d 35d 50d 
,#+PROPERTY: allocate_ALL dev doc test
,#+COLUMNS: %30ITEM(Task) %Effort %allocate %BLOCKER %ORDERED

If you export the example above you'll TaskJuggler will schedule the
tasks as shown in the screen shot below

#+CAPTION: Gantt Chart with dependencies
#+ATTR_HTML: alt="Gantt Chart with dependencies"
[[file:../images/taskjuggler/TaskJugglerUI3.png]]

Also TaskJuggler will give you a overview how busy youre resources
will be and what they are working on. See below for a screen shot:

#+CAPTION: Resource usage chart
#+ATTR_HTML: alt="Resource usage chart"
[[file:../images/taskjuggler/resource-graph.png]]

Finally you can generate [[file:../images/taskjuggler/project-plan.pdf][good-looking project plans]] in PDF by printing
from TaskJuggler. This will make any [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointy-haired_Boss][Pointy-haired Boss]] happy.

* Export of other properties
Generally the exporter writes a node property that is known to
TaskJuggler (such as ~shift~, ~booking~, ~efficiency~, ~journalentry~,
~rate~ for resources or ~account~, ~start~, ~note~, ~duration~, ~end~,
~journalentry~, ~milestone~, ~reference~, ~responsible~, ~scheduling~,
etc for tasks) as is to the TaskJuggler file.

Other properties such as completeness or priority are derived from
implicit information in the Org mode file. The TODO state for example
determines the completeness. A task will be exported with 100%
complete (~complete 100~) if it is marked as done. The priority of a
task will be determined through its priority cookie.


* Footnotes
[fn:1] You can customize this tag

[fn:2] Again, of course this tag can be customized

[fn:3] by downcasing the headline, replacing non-ascii characters with
'_' and picking the first word if it is unique

[fn:4] In TaskJuggler the allocations are cumulative, the exporter
however adds some code so that inherited allocation are ignored when
explicitly assigning a resource.
