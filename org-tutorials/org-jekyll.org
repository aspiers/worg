* Introduction.
[[http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll][Jekyll]] is a static web site generator written in Ruby. It can
transform various text markups, using a templating language, into
static html. The resulting site can be served by almost any web server
without requiring additional components such as php. Jekyll is the
tool used to produce Github's pages.

This article discusses how to produce both a static site and a blog
using Jekyll and org. Rather than writing a markup processor for org
files, I have relied on org's html export features to generate files
that can be processed by Jekyll.

Org already has an excellent html export engine. However, it lacks
built in support for blogging. Using Jekyll also gives more control
over the final appearance of your site.

Publishing your site with org and Jekyll involves three steps:

- write your page content using org.

- use org to export your pages to html in the Jekyll project directory.

- run Jekyll to convert your html pages exported from org into your
  final site.

By default Jekyll produces its output in the _site directory of
Jekyll's working directory. This is a self contained version of your
site, which can be deployed to your web server. The files in _site are
completely self contained, so all you need to do is to copy them to
your web server. Methods include using ftp, rsync or a git post commit
hook. You can configure where Jekyll puts its published files in
_config.yml.

Essentially, I am using org to produce everything between the <body>
tags on the page and Jekyll to produce the rest. Note that you can
easily embed html content in your org pages using the +BEGIN_HTML tag.

* Install Jekyll.

Installation is described at the [[http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll][Jekyll]] web site. 

* Project Directory Structure.
Jekyll expects a certain directory structure. In the example below my
Jekyll project is in a directory called "jekyll". Blog posts are in
"_posts" and the layout templates in "_layouts". The "_includes"
directory is for files containing code you want to include in other
pages e.g. a header or sidebar.

The file _config.yml is a YAML file that contains Jekyll's
configuration for the site.

In addition to the "_posts" directory you can create other directories
to hold different non blog parts of your site.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
'|myproject
'|   |org
'|      |_posts
'|      |-- 2009-11-26-my-first-post.org
'|   |index.org
'|   |jekyll
'|   -- _config.yml
'|   -- _layouts
'|      |-- default.html
'|      `-- post.html
'|   -- _posts
'|      |-- 2009-11-26-my-first-post.html
'|      
'|   -- |_site
'|   -- |_includes
`    -- index.html
#+END_EXAMPLE


You should setup the directory structure of your org files to mirror
that of the Jekyll project. Then when you export your org files as
html the files will end up in the correct place in your Jekyll
project. I usually place the directory containing my org files in the
directory about the Jekyll project directory to make sure that Jekyll
doesn't consider .org files to be part of its project.

* Configuring org html Export.
The fundamentals of publishing html are described on [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.php][worg]]. I am
assuming that you have a basic working org publishing setup. By
default org produces complete web pages. However, as I am using Jekyll
I am only really interested in the section of the page between the
<body> tags, as Jekyll produces the rest. Most things in org are
configurable and it's possible to tell org to export only the bits of
the page between the <body> tags. Here is the relevant section of my .emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(

  ("org-ianbarton"
          ;; Path to your org files.
          :base-directory "~/devel/ianbarton/org/"
          :base-extension "org"

          ;; Path to your Jekyll project.
          :publishing-directory "~/devel/ianbarton/jekyll/"
          :recursive t
          :publishing-function org-publish-org-to-html
          :headline-levels 4 
          :html-extension "html"
          :body-only t ;; Only export section between <body> </body>
    )


    ("org-static-ian"
          :base-directory "~/devel/ianbarton/org/"
          :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf\\|php"
          :publishing-directory "~/devel/ianbarton/"
          :recursive t
          :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

    ("ian" :components ("org-ianbarton" "org-static-ian"))

))
#+END_SRC

To export my site I just run "C-c e X ian".

You need to set the destination of your exported files to your Jekyll
project directory. Assuming you have set up your org directory
structure to mirror that of your Jekyll project everything should end
up in the correct place.

* Creating an org File to be Published with Jekyll.
When you run Jekyll it processes the source files for your site and
any files with YAML Font Matter are subject to special processing. The
Font Matter is used to tell Jekyll how to format your page.

Bear in mind that Jekyll doesn't process your .org files, but the
.html files produced by exporting. So when writing an org file it
should be formatted in such a way that when exported it produces html
suitable for processing by Jekyll.

YAML Font Matter must be the first thing in the file, with
no blank lines above the Font Matter Section. A typical Font Matter
Section would look like:

---
layout: default
title: My Page Title.
---

So you should ensure that any Font Matter directives come first in
your org file.

Note that the three hyphens "---" are part of the markup and are
required. The layout tag tells Jekyll which layout from its _layouts
directory should be used to format your page. You can include any
other keys in the Font Matter section (e.g. title:), which you can use
in your page. See the Jekyll [[http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/yaml-front-matter][wiki]] for more details on Font Matter.

Below is a short extract from one of my org files showing my setup:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+STARTUP: showall indent
#+STARTUP: hidestars
#+BEGIN_HTML
---
layout: default
title: Benighted on the Ben.
excerpt: An unplanned bivouac on Ben Nevis.
---
#+END_HTML
It was early January when six of us travelled up to ....
#+END_EXAMPLE

The Font Matter section is wrapped in #+BEGIN_HTML so it is exported
literally to the final html file. You may need to upgrade your org
version as older versions produced two blank lines before the Font
Matter section when exported. You can define your own Font Matter keys and use
them within your generated page. In the above example I use the
"excerpt" key to display "teasers" for a blog post.

Note that the current git version of org removes the first "---" if the
directory containing the file start with an underscore. The workaround
is to start your file with "---" in both the first two lines.

Carsten has also provided two hooks that are run after exporting is
complete, which can also be used to tidy up the output:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
org-export-html-final-hook      (always)
org-publish-after-export-hook   (when going through org-publish)
#+END_SRC

Once you have exported your org project to html it's simply a matter
of running jekyll to produce the final output. By default Jekyll puts
its output in the _site directory of your project, but you can
customize this in your _config.yml file.

* Blogging with Jekyll and Org.

Jekyll has built in support for blogging. Anything you place in the
_posts directory of your Jekyll project is considered as a blog
post. However, the file names of your posts must adhere to the
following format:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
yyyy-mm-dd-post_name.html
#+END_EXAMPLE

To write a post just create a new file with the correct filename in
your org/_posts directory. You may find that Yasnippet is useful for
inserting Font Matter and other directives in your org file. When you
have finished just run C-c e X project_name to export your org project
as html and then run jekyll to generate your site.

You can use Jekyll's [[http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/template-data][template]] markup to decide how your blog posts are
displayed. On the Jekyll [[http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites][sites]] page there are many sites with source
listed, so you can study how other people use the markup to create
their blog. You can also view my site http://www.ian-barton.com and
see a snapshot of the source at
http://github.com/geekinthesticks/ianbarton .

You can assign categories to your posts either by placing posts inside
folders like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
_posts/org/jekyll/howto.html

#+END_EXAMPLE

This would assign your post to the "org" and "jekyll" categories.

or by using YAML markup in your org file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
categories:
    - org
    - linux
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Showing Blog Posts on the Front Page.
Most blogs show the latest posts on their front page. The example
below shows the title and an excerpt for the five latest posts:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<ul class="posts">
{% for post in site.posts limit: 5 %}
  <div class="post_info">
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> <span>({{ post.date | date:"%Y-%m-%d" }})</span></li>
    </br> <em>{{ post.excerpt }} </em>
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
#+END_EXAMPLE


** Creating Archive Pages.
You will probably only want to display a limited number of blog posts
on your front page. However, you will also want to make older pages
available. You can create a simple list of all blog posts using the
following markup:

#+BEGIN-EXAMPLE
        <ul>
          {% for post in site.posts %}
            <li>
              <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">
                <span class="date">
                  <span class="day">{{ post.date | date: '%d' }}</span> 
                  <span class="month"><abbr>{{ post.date | date: '%b' }}</abbr></span>
                  <span class="year">{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}</span>
                </span>
                <span class="title">{{ post.title }}</span>
              </a>
            </li>
          {% endfor %}
        </ul>
+END_EXAMPLE

* Inserting Images.
You will probably want to insert some images into your blog posts. I
use the following method:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<img src ="/images/skiddaw.jpg"
"alt"="John and Ella on Skiddaw" align ="left" width="300"
height="250" title="John and Ella on Skiddaw" class="img"</img>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that the class attribute refers to the class used to style the
image tag in your css. My css contains:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
img {
    margin: 15px;
    border: 1px solid blue;
}

#+END_EXAMPLE

Note that if you wish to have some space between your image and the
text, using padding in your css doesn't seem to work. I use margin,
which gives the same effect.

Whilst this works, it won't display captions for your
images. Unfortunately, after years of development xhtml doesn't seem
to provide an easy way to display image captions. I decided to use the
method described [[http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/figures][here]]. An example from of floating a picture to the
right of the text is shown below.

In your .org file use the following html to embed the picture:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<div class="photofloatr">
  <p><img src="myphoto.jpg" width="300"
    height="150" alt="My Mug Shot"></p>
  <p>A photo of me</p>
</div>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now you need to add some information to your style sheet:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
div.photofloatr {
    float: right;
    border: thin silver solid;
    margin: 0.5em;
    padding: 0.5em;
}

div.photofloatr p {
  text-align: center;
  font-style: italic;
  font-size: smaller;
  text-indent: 0;
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

A third method, which I haven't tried myself, is to use the jQuery EXIF
plugin to extract the caption from the image EXIF data and use
Javascript to display it. See [[http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/exif/][here]] for  more details.

* Using Text Markup in Font Matter.
By default text in the Font Matter part of your file isn't processed
by Jekyll's markup engine. However, you can use the Textilize filter
to convert your Font Matter string into HTML, formatted using textile
markup.

I use this to format my page excerpts, which I include in my org files
Font Matter markup. So in my sites index.html I have:

#+BEGIN-EXAMPLE
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a> <span>({{ post.date | date:"%Y-%m-%d" }})</span></li>
    </br> <em>{{ post.excerpt | textilize}} </em>

#+END-EXAMPLE

This lets me use textile markup in my page excerpts, which are defined
in my page's YAML Font Matter section.

* Version Control with Jekyll.
Jekyll is amenable to using version control systems. If you follow my
suggested directory structure you can create a git repo to your top
level directory. You can then create a post-commit script that runs
the org html export and then runs Jekyll to generate your site.

* HappyBlogger's Jekyll Modifications.
Bjørn Arild Mæland has created some modifications to Jekyll to
provide some pre-processing to org files to allow for better
integration with Jekyll. You can find his code on [[http://github.com/bmaland/happyblogger][github]].
* Other Blog Solutions for org.
** Blorgit
[[http://orgmode.org/worg/blorgit.php][Blorgit]] uses org mode for markup and runs on the Sinatra mini
framework. It is amenable to using git for posting and maintenance.
** ikiwiki
[[http://ikiwiki.info/][ikiwiki]] is a web site compiler written in Perl. In many ways it is
similar to Jekyll, but has closer integration with version control
systems. It supports blogging and has many plugins.

There is an org mode plugin by [[http://www.golden-gryphon.com/blog/manoj/blog/2008/06/08/Using_org-mode_with_Ikiwiki/][Manoj]], which lets you write your posts in org
and converts them to html suitable for processing by ikiwiki.
