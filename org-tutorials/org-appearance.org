This page is about customizing the appearance of Org-mode.

* Customizing Org appearance

To customize all aspects of Org appearance use

#+begin_example
=M-x customize-group RET org-font-lock RET=
#+end_example

Here you will find several options that can be chaged, and a further
link to a page for customizing [[id:f47abcd0-e31e-4b23-87db-d916d21665ad][Org-mode faces]].

* Customize Org-mode faces
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       f47abcd0-e31e-4b23-87db-d916d21665ad
  :END:

A "face" is the term emacs uses to refer to the font and colour of
some text (as well as other features such as underlining etc).

Customizing Org faces is straightforward:

#+begin_example
=M-x customize-group RET org-faces RET=
#+end_example

You can also customize faces on the fly by just calling the
=customize-face= command with the cursor on the face you want to
customize.

* Customizing the title, date, author and email lines.
  
  The title, date and author information for an org document are
  specified using the special keywords =#+TITLE:=, =#+DATE=,
  =#+AUTHOR=, =#+EMAIL=.

  By default, title, author, date and email lines appear in dark blue
  with the initial keywords greyed out. The title is in a larger font
  than the others. To change this, customize the faces
  
  - org-document-title
  - org-document-info
  - org-document-info-keyword
   
  In addition, the variable org-hidden-keywords can be used to make the
  corresponding keywords disappear.

* Org-mode ready color-themes

A popular way of customizing Emacs colors is to use the color-theme
package (see [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ColorTheme][color-theme emacswiki page]].)

Here is a list of color themes that are aware of Org:
