* Introduction

  Org provides three different functions for performing searches and
  data dependent calculations in tables. These functions can, among
  other things, be used to implement associative arrays, count
  matching cells, rank results, or group data. The following examples
  will hopefully help you in getting started with these functions.

* Associative array with unique keys

  The most straightforward use of lookups is to treat part of an org
  table as an associative array: a key can be used to look up a
  corresponding value. 

  Say you are taking a trip to Scandinavia, and you want to keep track
  of how much money you have spent on the trip. You decide to convert
  all sums to euros. Before your trip you write down the following
  table of approximate currency rates.
:  #+TBLNAME: rates
: | currency        | abbreviation | euros |
: |-----------------+--------------+-------|
: | euro            | eur          |     1 |
: | Norwegian krone | nok          |  0.14 |
: | Swedish krona   | sek          |  0.12 |
: | US dollar       | usd          |  0.77 |

  In what follows we will use the function =org-lookup-first= and the
  previous table =rates= to automatically convert the sums in
  different currencies to euros. The signature of function
  =org-lookup-first= looks as follows:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (org-lookup-first VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)  
  #+END_SRC
  Assuming that =PREDICATE= is =nil=, in which case the default
  predicate =equal= is used, this function does a search for the first
  instance of =VAL= in =S-LIST= and returns the a value from the
  corresponding position in =R-LIST=. In the table below, each sum is
  assigned a currency abbreviation; a lookup is done in table =rates=
  above in the second column for the corresponding abbreviation, and
  then the corresponding rate is returned from the third column. For
  each row only the first four columns need to filled; columns 5 and 6
  are calculated automatically. Notice that an error results if the
  key is not found: in the last row, an empty key is being searched
  for.

: |  date | expense          |  sum | currency |   rate |  euros |
: |-------+------------------+------+----------+--------+--------|
: |  1.3. | flights          |  324 | eur      |      1 |    324 |
: |  4.6. | books and maps   |  243 | usd      |   0.77 | 187.11 |
: | 30.7. | rental car       | 8300 | sek      |   0.12 |   996. |
: |  2.7. | hotel            | 1150 | sek      |   0.12 |   138. |
: |  2.7. | lunch            |  190 | sek      |   0.12 |   22.8 |
: |  3.7. | fishing licenses | 1400 | nok      |   0.14 |   196. |
: |  3.7. | gasoline         |  340 |          | #ERROR | #ERROR |
:  #+TBLFM: $5='(org-lookup-first $4 '(remote(rates,@2$2..@>$2)) '(remote(rates,@2$3..@>$3)))::$6=$5*$3

* Multiple matches with preferred ordering

  A common task for teachers is the assignment of exam grades from
  total marks. The starting point for such grading is a table with
  grade boundaries. Below is one such table, with the rows in
  increasing order of the lower bound required for a particular grade.

:  #+TBLNAME: grade-boundaries
: | lower bound | grade |
: |-------------+-------|
: |           0 | F     |
: |          10 | D     |
: |          20 | C     |
: |          30 | B     |
: |          40 | A     |

  We will use the function =org-lookup-last= and the previous table
  =grade-boundaries= to assign grades to students based on their
  marks. The signature of function =org-lookup-last= is exactly like
  the signature of =org-lookup-first=:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (org-lookup-last VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)  
  #+END_SRC
  However, this function does a search for the /last/ match in
  =S-LIST= and returns the a value from the corresponding position in
  =R-LIST=. Here the idea of the lookup used in assigning the grade is
  as follows. Say a student's exam result is 33 marks.  We look for
  the /last/ row in the table for which the student's marks are greater
  than or equal to the lower bound; in this case it is the row with
  lower bound 30. The student's grade is the corresponding element from
  the second column, in this case a B.

  Thus, given the number of marks =VAL= of a student, we find the last
  row of the first column of table =grade-boundaries= for which the
  lower bound =S= fulfils ~(>= VAL S)~. Thus we will use ~>=~ as
  =PREDICATE= to perform the matching. Note that =VAL= and =S= are
  assigned as arguments to the predicate in the order they are in the
  signature of =org-lookup-last=, where =VAL= precedes =S-LIST=. The
  following table does the conversion from total marks to the final
  grade.  Notice the literal interpolation =L= of table values into
  the Elisp formula, which is needed because some values are numbers
  and some are symbols.

: | student | marks | grade |
: |---------+-------+-------|
: | X       |    30 | B     |
: | Y       |    29 | C     |
: | Z       |     5 | F     |
: | W       |    55 | A     |
:  #+TBLFM: $3='(org-lookup-last $2 '(remote(grade-boundaries,@2$1..@>$1)) '(remote(grade-boundaries,@2$2..@>$2)) '>=);L

* Counting matching cells

  The function =org-lookup-all= can not be used by itself in a table
  equation, because it returns a list of values. However, powerful
  lookup tasks can be performed by combining the function with other
  Elisp functions.

  As a simple example consider counting the number of missing values
  in a table. The signature of function =org-lookup-all= is exactly
  like the signatures of the other two lookup functions:
  #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (org-lookup-all VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)  
  #+END_SRC
  However, this function does a search for the /all/ matches in
  =S-LIST= and returns the all corresponding values from the
  corresponding positions in =R-LIST=. As is the case with
  =org-lookup-first= and =org-lookup-last=, if =R-LIST= is =nil=, then
  the corresponding matching values of =S-LIST= are returned
  directly. Notice the use of the =E= flag to retain empty fields in
  the range. Also notice that in this case we are doing the lookup in
  a true two-dimensional range, which is thus also possible

: | group | round 1 | round 2 |
: |-------+---------+---------|
: | A     |         |     2.4 |
: | B     |     4.7 |      11 |
: | C     |         |         |
: | D     |       5 |         |
: | E     |         |     7.2 |
: | F     |     3.2 |     4.3 |
: | G     |         |     4.4 |
: | H     |         |       8 |
: |-------+---------+---------|
: | total | missing |       7 |
:  #+TBLFM: @>$3='(length(org-lookup-all "" '(@2$2..@-1$3) nil));E

* Ranking results

  Another example application of =org-lookup-all= is an automatic
  ranking of results. In the table below, a larger total number of
  marks is better. Notice that the Elisp expression also
  automatically takes care of ties.

: | group | marks | rank |
: |-------+-------+------|
: | A     |    22 |    2 |
: | B     |    22 |    2 |
: | C     |    14 |    4 |
: | D     |    28 |    1 |
: | E     |     9 |    5 |
:  #+TBLFM: $3='(+ 1 (length (org-lookup-all $2 '(@2$2..@>$2) nil '<)));N

* Frequency counts from raw data
  A common situation in the analysis of data is the classification
  (grouping) of raw data values for, e.g., visualisation. Often this
  is done by counting the frequencies of observations within certain
  bounds. The function =org-lookup-all=, combined with other Elisp
  functions, can be used to perform this task. This example also shows
  how to construct more complicated lookup rules using multiple values
  from a table.

  Consider the following table with different results from different
  groups A-I.
:  #+TBLNAME: raw-data
: | group | result |
: |-------+--------|
: | A     |    2.3 |
: | B     |    4.2 |
: | C     |    1.1 |
: | D     |    3.6 |
: | E     |    4.5 |
: | F     |    2.4 |
: | G     |    1.0 |
: | H     |    2.3 |
: | I     |    2.8 |

  We will classify the results into different, mutually exclusive
  classes. For example, the observations that will belong to the first
  class are in the interval =[1, 1.9]= (endpoints included). In order
  to perform this classification, we define the following two-place
  predicate function =in-interval=. Notice that the first parameter of
  this function is a pair whose first element is the lower bound and
  second member the upper bound of the interval.

:  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
:    (defun in-interval (bounds el)
:      (and (>= el (car bounds)) (<= el (cadr bounds))))
:  #+END_SRC

:  #+RESULTS:
:  : in-interval

  Using this predicate function, we can construct a table with class
  boundaries and corresponding frequencies. Note that the first
  argument to the function =org-lookup-all=, which is then passed over
  as the first argument to the predicate =in-interval=, is the pair of
  bounds.

: | lower bound | upper bound | frequency |
: |-------------+-------------+-----------|
: |           1 |         1.9 |         2 |
: |           2 |         2.9 |         4 |
: |           3 |         3.9 |         1 |
: |           4 |         4.9 |         2 |
:  #+TBLFM: $3='(length (org-lookup-all '($1 $2) '(remote(raw-data,@2$2..@>$2)) nil 'in-interval));N
* Conclusion

  The org lookup functions can be used for a large number of different
  data-dependent calculations. For example, the following spreadsheet
  operations familiar to libreoffice or Excel users can be implemented
  using them: =HLOOKUP=, =VLOOKUP=, =COUNTIF=, =SUMIF= and
  =FREQUENCY=. If you have other interesting examples of the use of
  these functions, feel free to send them to the [[https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode][org mailing list]] and
  we will be happy to add them on this page.
