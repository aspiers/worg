* Weaving a budget with Org & ledger

Since I am intending this tutorial for worg, I will assume that the
reader is familiar with Org. If you are not, but are an emacs user, I
encourage you to explore Org. It is an invaluable piece of software.

Now, assuming that you are familiar (or have familiarized yourself)
with Org, you might also be interested in using ledger. If you already
are using it, this tutorial is for you. If you are new to ledger, you
might find the [[http://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html][manual]] useful. The [[http://hledger.org/step-by-step][hledger step-by-step]] guide is also
useful, though intended for hledger (a close cousin of ledger). I
don’t intend to introduce the reader to ledger in this document.

Now, ledger comes with a built in budget system, but I wanted to get
an “envelope” style budget working. While this was easy to do in
theory, in practice it proved more difficult. The theory is pretty
simple; enevelope budgeting merely requires you to create new accounts
to keep track of each “envelope” of money, and assign all of your
income to those separate accounts. But in practice, it requires a huge
amount of duplicate data-entry, even when using ledger’s automatic
transactions, because each month’s budget tends to *mostly* but not
*exactly* the same as the last month’s. This quickly becomes a
nightmare when you want to change your monthly food budget over the
past six months. The following document describes how I managed to get
something working, with nice reporting, using Org’s babel and noweb
features.

** The theory

In theory, ledger can easily be used to manage an envelope budget. The
basic idea is that you will place all your money in different
=Budgeted= accounts. For instance, if you earn $1000/mo and want to
place half of that money in your food budget and the other half in
your bars budget, you would use:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
2014/01/01 Income
  Assets:Checking         $1000
  Income                 -$1000
  Budgeted:Expenses:Food   $500
  Budgeted:Expenses:Bars   $500
  Budget                 -$1000
#+END_EXAMPLE

(The =Budget= account is to ensure things balance; it should be equal
to your income.)

Now, you will use automated transactions to deplete your budget as you
move money to your =Expenses= accounts. Here is an automated
transaction that will work for all your expenses in 2014 and
afterwards:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
= expr (date>=[2014] and account =~ /^Expenses:/)
  Budgeted:$account        -1
  Budget                    1
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now, given expense transactions that look like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
2014/01/02 Foo
  Assets:Checking      -$100
  Expenses:Food         $100
#+END_EXAMPLE

this will add, for every posting that starts with =Expenses=, a
posting to =Budgeted:Expenses= and to =Budget=. This will result in
the automated equivalent of having entered:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
2014/01/02 Foo
  Assets:Checking         -$100
  Expenses:Food            $100
  Budgeted:Expenses:Foo   -$100
  Budget                   $100
#+END_EXAMPLE

The automated transaction saves us a great deal of repetetive work, as
you can see.

Now, this solution will work. Each month, you will replenish your
budget accounts by an amount equaling your income for that month, and
as you spend money the budget accounts will be depleted as you spend
money. But the trickiest part, I found, was in adjusting your budget
as needed. For instance, I found that I needed a base budget for
things like food and gas, but that other items might suddenly stop.
For instance, you might cancel your cable, or take up a new hobby. You
can copy and paste your base budget, but then when you go back to
retroactively change your food budget (as you will probably need to,
to adjust to the fact that you are spending more or less than
anticipated), you need to go back and change all those budget entries.
This quickly becomes a hassle.

** The practice (Org enters the picture)

This is where Org, and particularly babel’s noweb features come in.
But first, let’s look at how you can use Org to generate some useful
reports. Here is how I generate last month’s expenses:

: * Last month's expenses
: #+begin_src ledger :cmdline bal -p "last month" ^Expenses: :results output :exports results
: !include /path/to/ledger.lgr
: #+end_src

(You may need to ensure that =ob-ledger= is loaded into your Org;
see the [[file:../org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-ledger.org][ob-ledger doc]] for details.) Now, if you type =C-c C-c= on this
entry, it will generate a report of your expenses last month, which
will be placed after the source block, and will look like:

: #+RESULTS:
: #+begin_example
:             $150.00  Expenses
:             $100.00    Food
:              $50.00    Bars
: --------------------
:             $150.00
: #+end_example

By using babel, you can generate a lot of useful reports and keep them
up-to-date, exporting them to HTML or PDF for printing, etc.

But some of the really useful features come when you use Org’s noweb
to weave a budget together. noweb allows, among other things, you to
include source blocks in other blocks. First, you’ll set up your base
budget, which will be included in every budget. Say you know that
every month you will spend $500 on food. You create a ledger source
block with a name, =base-budget=:

: #+name: base-budget
: #+begin_src ledger
:   ; :BUDGET:
:   Budgeted:Expenses:Food  $500
:   Budgeted:Savings
: #+end_src

This means that you want $500 to go to food, and the balance to
savings. (The first line =; :BUDGET:= is a tag to let you identify
this as a budget; this helps with some reports.) Now, you can set up
your budget block:

: #+name: budget
: #+begin_src ledger :noweb yes
: = expr (date>=[2014] and account =~ /^Expenses:/)
:   Budgeted:$account        -1
:   Budget  1
:
: 2014/01/01 * Budget
:  <<base-budget>>
:  Budget  -$1000
: #+end_src

What you have done here is set up your automated transaction, as
above, and set up your first month’s budget. You have assumed that
your first month’s income is $1000, and you have included your base
budget. When this is woven by noweb, =<<base-budget>>= will be
replaced with the =base-budget= source block, and Org will pass the
following on to ledger:

: 2014/01/01 * Budget
:   Budgeted:Expenses:Food  $500
:   Budgeted:Savings
:   Budget                -$1000

This will set up $500 in your food budget, and the balance ($500) for
savings.

Now, to generate a report, you can use the following:

: #+begin_src ledger :cmdline bal -p "this year" ^Budgeted:Expenses -E :results output :exports results :noweb yes
: <<budget>>
: !include /path/to/ledger.lgr
: #+end_src

Running this report (=C-c C-c=) will tell you your budget balance for
each expense. If you budgeted $500 for food and spent $600, your
balance will be -$100. If you spend $300, your balance will be $200.

Each month, month, you will create a new budget entry in your =budget=
source block, with the =Budget= account equaling your income that
month. You will include your =<<base-budget>>=, and any adjustments
you want to make.

For example, say that in June you take up cycling. You want to budget
$100 per month for this, but you want to start in June, not January.
You will add the following entry to your =budget= source block:

: 2014/06/01 * Budget
:  <<base-budget>>
:  Budgeted:Expenses:Cycling  $100
:  Budget                   -$1000

This means that for June your budget will be $500 for food, $100 for
cycling, and $400 for savings.

Now, you will need to keep adding the cycling budget line every time
from now on, so you might want, at some point, to get complicated. You
could define a new source block with the name =base-budget-new=,
include your old =base-budget=, using =<<base-budget>>=, and then
include that in your budget entries going forward, to avoid duplicate
typing. noweb should allow you to structure your budget entries
however you like.

I’ve found this solution to be flexible enough to allow me to manage a
budget that is contantly being adjusted, and easy to generate
printable reports. ledger and Org make an excellent pair.
