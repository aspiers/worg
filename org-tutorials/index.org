* General Introductions to Org-mode

- [[http://orgmode.org/GoogleTech.html][Google Tech Talk about Org-mode]], a 45 minute talk given by Carsten
  Dominik during a visit at [[http://maps.google.com/%3Fq%3D37.423156,-122.084917%2B(Google%20Inc.)&hl%3Den][Google]].

- [[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9116][Getting Organized with Emacs Org-mode]] by [[http://www.planetizen.com/user/2][Abhijeet Chavan]], an article
  originally published in the [[http://www.linuxjournal.com/][Linux Journal]].

- [[file:orgtutorial_dto.org][The OrgMode tutorial]] by [[http://dto.freeshell.org/notebook/][David O'Toole]], covering the basics of TODO
  lists and the agenda.  It has been translated into [[file:orgtutorial_dto-fr.org][French]], [[http://hpcgi1.nifty.com/spen/index.cgi?OrgMode%2fOrgTutorial][Japanese]],
  [[http://hokmen.chan.googlepages.com/OrgTutorial.en-cn.html][Chinese]], and [[http://jmjeong.com/index.php?display=Emacs/OrgMode][Korean]].

- [[http://jaderholm.com/screencasts.html][A 25 minute screencast]] by [[http://jaderholm.com][Scott Jaderholm]], demonstrating the basic
  features of Org-mode.

- [[http://sachachua.com/wp/2008/01/18/outlining-your-notes-with-org/][Outlining Your Notes with Org]] by [[http://sachachua.com/wp/][Sacha Chua]] covers outlining,
  searching and internal links.

- [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/orgmode.html][Using Emacs org-mode for GTD]] by [[http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/][Charles Cave]] contains an
  introduction into Org-mode, among other things.  Charles has also
  written a more extensive document ([[id:50A0DEB1-4B63-4CC4-840E-313615C4BAE3][see below]]), but here we still
  link to the earlier version because of it's nice overview over
  Org-mode.

- Emacs Org-mode, [[http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/8547][video version of a 2-hour talk]] by Russell Adams at
  the [[http://www.hlug.org/][Houston Linux User Group]].  The first half of the first hour is
  /not/ about Org-mode, but about the Linux command =xargs=.  Then
  Russell introduces Org-mode, and, after letting the audience watch
  [[http://orgmode.org/GoogleTech.html][Carsten's Google Tech Talk]] (not part of the video) gives a hands-on
  demonstration about how he uses Org-mode.


* Power users describe their setup
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:

  In the following documents, the authors describe the details of
  their setup, along with the workflows they use to get organized with
  Org-mode.  While as a beginner you probably should start with only a
  simple setup, these descriptions will be a fantastic source of
  inspiration once you start growing your use of Org-mode.

    other things) categories, effort estimates, tags, scheduling, and
    custom agenda commands.
