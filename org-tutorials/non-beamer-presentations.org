* Introduction

While [[file:org-beamer/tutorial.org][Beamer]] is a great option for generating high-quality
presentations from Org-mode documents, sometimes a lighter-weight
simpler option is desirable.  This page presents the alternative
options for giving quick slide-show presentations from Org-mode
documents.

- [[Epresent]] :: is an Emacs minor mode for giving presentations.  The
     Emacs editor is used in a full-screen mode as the presentation
     engine, and headings of the Org-mode buffer are presented
     directly (with a few nice bells and whistles).

- [[S5]] :: is a standards-based suite for writing slide-show
     presentations in html web pages.  The browser is used as the
     presentation engine, and a slightly altered form of Org-mode's
     HTML export serves as the base of the presentation.

- org-html5presentation :: Is an Exporter of Org-mode documents to
     HTML5 slide show presentations.
     (see [[https://gist.github.com/509761][gist.github.com/509761]] for code and usage information)

- [[org-tree-slide]] :: is a simple tool to treat a tree of an org buffer as
     a single slide. Since each slide is displayed by simple narrowing,
     an editable presentation is easily achieved without restricting
     the functionality of Org Mode. And usage of org-tree-slide is not
     limited to a presentation. Three profiles are predefined for
     different use cases.

- [[org-reveal]] :: is an Org-mode extension that exports Org documents
                into Reveal.js presentations. Reveal.js is a web-based
                presentation framework with 3-D effects, customizable
                themes and animations, powered by the latest HTML5
                technologies. For details, please check the [[org-reveal]]
                section below.

* Epresent
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Epresent
  :END:

Epresent was originally developed on top of outline mode by Tom
Tromey.  Eric Schulte then adopted it for work with Org-mode.  The
code for using Org-mode with epresent is available at
https://github.com/eschulte/epresent.

Epresent leverages existing Org-mode features like inline image
display, inline latex fragments, and in-buffer code fontification to
generate very nice (if somewhat nerdy) looking presentations directly
from within Emacs.  This has the nice benefit that during-presentation
editing and code evaluation is possible.

The README file in the epresent repository has instillation
instructions, however usage is as simple as...
1. =M-x load-file epresent.el=
2. open the example =present.org= file located in the repository
3. call =M-x epresent-run=
4. press "=t=" to view the top level of the presentation
5. navigate the presentation with "=n=", "=p=", "=t=" and quit with "=q="

* S5
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: S5
  :END:

[[http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/][S5]] is a "/Simple Standards-Based Slide Show System/" implemented using
HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Two S5 options exist for Org-mode.

1. Yann Hodique has developed a javascript based option which works
   directly with Org-mode's existing html export.

   This technique is described on Yann's blog
   [[http://www.hodique.info/blog/2009/11/14/s5_presentation_from_org-mode][s5 presentation from org-mode]].

2. There is also code implementing an altered version of Org-mode's
   existing html export tailored to generating static S5
   presentations.

  This second technique is described below.

** Code and usage for =org-export-as-s5=.
- The emacs-lisp code available [[https://github.com/eschulte/org-S5/blob/master/org-export-as-s5.el][here]] defines a single function
  (=org-export-as-s5=) as a simple wrapper around Org-mode's existing
  html export.  This function is based heavily on Pierre de Buyl's
  [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/33143/match=s5][very thorough S5 export instructions]] posted to the Org-mode mailing
  list.

- Simply evaluate this code, or add it to your =.emacs=, then call
  =M-x org-export-as-s5= from within an Org-mode buffer. *Note*: the
  [[http://gitweb.adaptive.cs.unm.edu/org-S5.git/tree/HEAD:/ui][ui]] directory holding S5 support files must be located in the same
  directory as the exported html.

- Currently there are three themes which can be set with the
  following.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq org-s5-theme "railscast")   ; based off `color-theme-railscasts'
    (setq org-s5-theme "default")     ; the default S5 theme
    (setq org-s5-theme "i18n")        ; the i18n theme by the author of S5
  #+end_src

- This entire directory is available as a [[https://github.com/eschulte/org-S5/blob/master/org-export-as-s5.el][git repository]].

- For two examples of org-S5 in action see [[http://eschulte.github.io/org-S5/][here]].

* org-tree-slide
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: org-tree-slide
  :END:

org-tree-slide is an Emacs minor mode for Org Mode. Once you toggle
=M-x org-tree-slide-mode=, just type =C->= and =C-<= to move between slides.
To show CONTENT, type =C-x s c=. When you exit this minor mode,
the slideshow will be finished. It is recommended to customize the default
keybindings so that user can smoothly operate their presentations.

The code is available at [[https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide][Github]]. Please read [[https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide/blob/master/README.org][README.org]] and check the user
variables to make your presentation more attractive.

Download org-tree-slide from the following direct link:
[[https://raw.github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide/master/org-tree-slide.el]]

** Recommended key bindings and profiles

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<f8>") 'org-tree-slide-mode)
(global-set-key (kbd "S-<f8>") 'org-tree-slide-skip-done-toggle)
#+end_src

Preset profiles are defined in org-tree-slide.
1. =M-x org-tree-slide-simple-profile=            ; Simple use
2. =M-x org-tree-slide-presentation-profile=      ; Presentation use
3. =M-x org-tree-slide-narrowing-control-profile= ; TODO Pursuit with narrowing
These functions set user variables for each using scenario.
You can find more detail in [[https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide/blob/master/README.org][README.org]].

** Frame maximized presentation

Normally, presentations will appear in full screen or frame maximized.
[[https://github.com/takaxp/moom#org-mode-org-tree-slide][moom]] is useful in such cases since the package can change frame position and size
by keyboard and the font size will be increased suitably for your presentation.

* orgmode-slideshow

Sander Boer created orgmode-slideshow -- see his message:

I hacked together a javascript and a css that transforms the default html
export of my org file to a slide show:

- http://www.mauc.nl/presentations/test.html

Here's the org-file:

- http://www.mauc.nl/presentations/test.org

Here's the rest (depends on jQuery)

- http://www.mauc.nl/assets/css/orgmode-slideshow.css
- http://www.mauc.nl/assets/js/orgmode-slideshow.js

* org-reveal

  Reveal.js is a web-based presentation framework, with attracting
  features like:
  - 3-D slide transition effect.
  - 2-D slide arrangement.
  - Fragmented items.
  - Navigation control.
  - Slide thumbnail.
  - Customizable themes.

  An [[http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/][example of Reveal.js]] is available online.

  Org-reveal is an Org-mode extension that exports Org-mode documents
  into Reveal.js presentations. With org-reveal, you can easily
  organize Reveal.js presentations without knowing the detail of HTML,
  AND with some extra benifits:
  - Highlighted source codes.
  - Neat math equations.

** Sources

   Both Reveal.js and org-reveal are hosted on GitHub.
   * Reveal.js :: [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/]]
   * Org-reveal :: [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/]]

** Usage

   See org-reveal's [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/blob/master/Readme.org][Readme.org]] for detail instruction about installing
   Reveal.js/org-reveal and the setting ups.

   Though you can read it online, it is recommended to download the
   projects and read it in your Emacs, so that you can try exporting
   it to Reveal.js presentation while reading.
