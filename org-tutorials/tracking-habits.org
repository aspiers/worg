* Introduction

Task management systems such as GTD are good for keeping track of
projects and todos, as well as periodically recurring tasks. But what
is the best way for remembering the daily tasks that one wants to
develop as habits? Exercise, relaxation, household cleaning, diet,
kindness to others---such habitual obligations can often get lost in
the constant clamor of urgent todos. In the midst of everything else,
how can you learn to stop biting your nails?

Though the ultimate aim of developing good habits is to internalize
them so deeply that one needs no reminders (because they become
"second nature"), the most difficult stage is the month or so it takes
to learn a new habit. Success often depends both on a commitment to
develop a habit /and/ some external means of monitoring one's
progress.

This tutorial offers a couple of ideas of how to use org-mode to track
habits---with the ultimate aim, of course, of kicking bad habits and
learning good ones. A program as powerful as org-mode, of course, has
multiple routes to the same end, but these are a few of the techniques
that I have found helpful.

** Note: New Module (org-habit)

John Wiegley has written a new module for org-mode that provides a
much more robust means of tracking habits than the rather ad-hoc
methods outlined below. Check back here soon for more details about
the new module.

* Repeating Tasks

A habit is often something you'd like to do every day (or, in some
cases, every other day or every week). Org-mode makes scheduling such
repeating tasks very easy. To create a recurring task in org-mode,
simply schedule the task for the day you'd like to start and add a
"repeater" such as =+1d= for every day, =+2d= for every other day,
=+1w= for every week, and so on. Here's an example:

: ** TODO Lift weights
:    SCHEDULED: <2009-01-18 Sun +2d>

Now the agenda will remind you to lift weights every other day. When
you mark the item DONE, it will be reactivated as a TODO and
pushed two days into the future (in this case to January 20).

(If you are procrastinating often, you can add a period in front of
the repeater, such as =.+2d= which will reschedule the completed item
two days /after it is completed/.)

* Tracking Completion

Scheduling a habitual task is only a small step on the path to
internalizing it. You also need to provide yourself with some
incentive to learn the habit. Without such incentive, it is easy to
procrastinate, rescheduling the daily habits---the least urgent
todos---to tomorrow...and tomorrow...and tomorrow.

Some productivity guides suggest an simple method for learning a
habit. Let's say you want to exercise daily. Take a calendar and cross
out each day you exercise. Your goal is to keep the chain of X's
going.

Org-mode can provide similar tracking for recurring tasks via the
variable =org-log-repeat=. If this variable is set to "time", then a
timestamp will be recorded each time the item is marked done. For the
example above, the results would look like this:

: ** TODO Lift weights
:    SCHEDULED: <2009-01-22 Thu +2d> 
:    - State "DONE"       [2009-01-16 Fri 23:14]
:    - State "DONE"       [2009-01-14 Wed 17:25]

You can see whether you've "broken the chain" by reviewing the log of
when you completed the item. If you want even more detailed tracking
(or want to leave yourself encouraging notes), you can set
=org-log-repeat= to "note". Then, each time you complete a recurring
task, you will be prompted to enter a note.

If you want to enable such logging only for particular tasks, then you
can do so via properties:

: ** TODO Lift weights
:    SCHEDULED: <2009-01-20 Tue +2d>
:    - State "DONE"       [2009-01-18 Sun 23:22] \\
:      Way to go!
:   :PROPERTIES:
:   :LOGGING:  lognoterepeat
:   :END:

* Monitoring Progress

It's nice to have a record of how well you're learning your new habit.
But it's especially nice to get a visual representation that gives you
a quick overview of how often you've "broken the chain"---i.e., let
the new habit slip.

One easy way to get a visual representation of a habit is to keep a
quick chart in a table. If you want to make sure you exercise every
day, you could type the following:

: | Week Starting | Mon | Tues | Wed | Thurs | Fri | Sat | Sun 

And then press tab to create a nice table that you can fill in:

: | Week Starting | Mon | Tues | Wed | Thurs | Fri | Sat | Sun |
: |---------------+-----+------+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----|
: | Jan 12        | x   | x    | x   | x     |     | x   | x   |
: | Jan 20        | x   | x    | x   |       | x   | x   | x   |

Ooops. I forgot to exercise a couple of times.

For a more robust habit tracking, I use the following technique:

For each daily habit I want to develop, I create a recurring task. I
also add a special tag "DAILY". Then I make sure to check the task as
DONE each day I complete it:

: * Habits
: ** TODO Do dishes							 :DAILY:
:    SCHEDULED: <2009-01-22 Thu +1d> 
:    - State "DONE"       [2009-01-20 Tue 12:59]
:    - State "DONE"       [2009-01-21 Wed 20:10]
: ** TODO Exercise							 :DAILY:
:    SCHEDULED: <2009-01-22 Thu +1d> 
:    - State "DONE"       [2009-01-19 Mon 19:59]
:    - State "DONE"       [2009-01-21 Wed 07:58]
: ** TODO Floss								 :DAILY:
:   SCHEDULED: <2009-01-22 Thu +1d> 
:   - State "DONE"       [2009-01-19 Mon 17:15]
:   - State "DONE"       [2009-01-20 Tue 11:05]

In my agenda view I can quickly filter for daily habits using a
secondary query:

: C-c a / DAILY

Or I can filter out DAILY tasks to unclutter the agenda view:

: C-c a / - DAILY

Finally, I can see how well I've kept up with my habits by using a
custom agenda command:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" "Daily habits" 
	 ((agenda ""))
	 ((org-agenda-show-log t)
	  (org-agenda-ndays 7)
	  (org-agenda-log-mode-items '(state))
	  (org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notregexp ":DAILY:"))))
	;; other commands here
	))
#+END_SRC

This command gives me a weekly view of whether and when I accomplished my
daily goals:

: Week-agenda (W04):
: Monday     19 January 2009 W04
:   habits:     17:15...... State:     (DONE) TODO Floss                   :DAILY:
:   habits:     19:59...... State:     (DONE) TODO Exercise                :DAILY:
: Tuesday    20 January 2009
:   habits:     11:05...... State:     (DONE) TODO Floss                   :DAILY:
:   habits:     12:59...... State:     (DONE) TODO Do dishes               :DAILY:
: Wednesday  21 January 2009
:   habits:      7:58...... State:     (DONE) TODO Exercise                :DAILY:
:   habits:     20:10...... State:     (DONE) TODO Do dishes               :DAILY:
: Thursday   22 January 2009
:   habits:     Scheduled:  TODO Do dishes                                 :DAILY:
:   habits:     Scheduled:  TODO Exercise                                  :DAILY:
:   habits:     Scheduled:  TODO Floss                                     :DAILY:
: Friday     23 January 2009
: Saturday   24 January 2009
: Sunday     25 January 2009

Again, these are just a couple of ways that I use org-mode to keep
track of regular habits. I hope this brief tutorial gives a few more
ideas about how to use this wonderful time management program.
