* Start up
Org-mode LaTeX export is easy.  Place the following code in your
.emacs and you're ready to go.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-classes
               '("article"
                 "\\documentclass{article}"
                 ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")))  
#+end_src

This tells the Org-mode LaTeX exporter to use the standard LaTeX
=article= document class by default and to map Org-mode headlines and
lists to LaTeX sectioning and list commands, as follows:

#+begin_src org
  ,* section
  ,** itemize
  ,*** itemize, etc.
  ,    - itemize
#+end_src

Now you can pick a LaTeX export command from the export menu, =C-c
C-e=, and expect to find a well-formed LaTeX document with the same
base name as your org-mode buffer.

It could hardly be easier!

* Why LaTeX Export?

As the manual says, "Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO
lists, and doing project planning with a fast and effective plain-text
system."  LaTeX is a convenient interface to TeX, a typesetting system
that its author "intended for the creation of beautiful books â€” and
especially for books that contain a lot of mathematics."  Where do
these two activities--keeping notes and making beautiful books--overlap?

Org-mode is well supplied with a variety of other exporters.  The Org
ASCII exporter produces a readable and simple version of an Org file
for printing and sharing of notes.  The HTML exporter does such a good
job of preparing notes for the web that many people use it to create
entire web sites.  The XOXO exporter makes notes accessible to other
software applications and the DocBook exporter starts the journey to
many other formats, including LaTeX, using DocBook tools.

The niche for the LaTeX exporter is producing a version of an Org file
for printing and sharing notes that looks better than an ASCII
printout but that can be produced without the overhead required to
support DocBook.  All that is needed is a working LaTeX installation.
LaTeX distributions for all major platforms are today well-developed
and easy to use and maintain.

* More Highly-Structured Documents

You can prepare more highly structured LaTeX documents by adding a few
lines to =org-export-latex-classes= in the .emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-classes
               '("article"
                 "\\documentclass{article}"
                 ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
                 ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}")))
#+end_src

This setup produces the following document structure:

#+begin_src org
  ,* section
  ,** subsection
  ,*** subsubsection
  ,**** paragraph
  ,***** subparagraph
  ,****** itemize, etc.
  ,       - itemize
#+end_src

* Exporting Other LaTeX Document Classes

The LaTeX exporter can be configured to produce LaTeX output for
books, reports, letters or any other document class, including custom
classes.  These can be useful if notes need to be formatted to a
certain specification, such as a company technical manual, or if the
notes are quite long, as might be the case when Org-mode is used as a
laboratory or project notebook.

Here is a standard setup for export to a LaTeX book class:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-classes
               `("book"
                 "\\documentclass[11pt,letter]{book}"
                 ("\\part{%s}" . "\\part*{%s}")
                 ("\\chapter{%s}" . "\\chapter*{%s}")
                 ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}"))
               )
#+end_src

Then, in the Org file with a book-full of notes, add this line:

#+begin_src org
  #+LaTeX_CLASS: book 
#+end_src

* Specifying LaTeX Packages
According to its author, the LaTeX macro package "represents a balance
between functionality and ease of use."  The LaTeX user who adds
functionality through the addition of packages necessarily makes the
software more difficult to use.  Like LaTeX itself, the Org-mode LaTeX
exporter has struck its own balance between functionality and ease of
use with the addition of several LaTeX packages.  These are written
out in the LaTeX header as LaTeX \usepackage{} commands.

The names of the LaTeX packages are kept in a data structure designed
for ease of maintenance as additional features are added to the LaTeX
exporter.  Packages in the default packages list,
=org-export-latex-default-packages-alist=, are required to support all
features of the LaTeX exporter.  This list is typically specified in
the Org-mode source code and its documentation contains a warning not
to modify it.  Packages not included on the default packages list that
the user needs consistently can be added to
=org-export-latex-packages-alist=.  Packages needed for a particular
file can be specified by inserting a line like this in the Org-mode
buffer:
#+begin_src org
  ,#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{xyz}
#+end_src
* Using Custom Classes
If the user has custom LaTeX document classes that conflict with the
default packages or that only require a few of the default packages to
support all features of the LaTeX exporter, then this can be handled
in the .emacs using [DEFAULT-PACKAGES], [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES],
[PACKAGES], [NO-PACKAGES], [EXTRA], [NO-EXTRA].    

Here is a simple example that uses a LaTeX class that supports the
Org-mode requirements and leaves open the possibility of adding file
specific packages:
  
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'org-export-latex-classes
          '("article"
             "\\documentclass{org-ready}
             [NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
             [EXTRA]"
             ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
             ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
             ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
             ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
             ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}")))
#+end_src
* Creating PDF Output
The LaTeX exporter by default produces code ready for processing by
pdflatex.  pdflatex calls the pdfTeX program, a modern extension of
TeX that produces PDF output directly, using the standard LaTeX
macros.  pdfTeX is tightly integrated with PDF features such as
hypertext links and tables of contents, using LaTeX packages such as
hyperref, which is included in the default packages list.

Org-mode offers a command to produce a PDF file from the LaTeX export.
This is bound to =C-c C-e p=.  The command =C-c C-e d= does all this
*and* opens the PDF file in the default reader.

If you use a different TeX typesetting engine, then you will want to
modify the variable =org-latex-to-pdf-process=.  This is a list of
strings, each of which contains a call to one of the TeX typesetting
engines or to an auxiliary program, such as BibTeX, makeindex, etc.

* Exporting Parts of a Buffer
Tags can be used to select which parts of an Org-mode buffer are sent
to the LaTeX exporter.  The tags used for this purpose are held in
variables: =org-export-select-tags= is a list of tags, initially set
to =export=, that select a tree or sub-tree for export;
=org-export-exclude-tags= is a list of tags, initially set to
=noexport=, that exclude a tree or subtree for export.  The effect
they have on export is logical, but the logic isn't necessarily what
one might expect.  In particular, if both select tags and exclude tags
are to be used in the same buffer, then their use must follow certain
rules.  Also, the handling of unmarked trees and subtrees changes
depending on which tags are used and how they are used.

If neither select tags nor exclude tags are used, then all of the trees
and their subtrees are sent to the LaTeX exporter.  If, however, a
select tag is added to a tree as in the example below, then unmarked
trees will *not* be sent to the exporter.  Thus, the effect of a
select tag is not restricted to its tree; its effect extends to the
entire buffer.

#+begin_src org
  ,* Tree 1                                                             :export:
  ,   This is exported
  ,** Subtree 1
  ,   This is also exported
  ,* Tree 2
  ,  This is not exported
  ,** Subtree 2
  ,  This is not exported, either
#+end_src

Once the scope of the tag's effect is grasped, the primary rule of using
select and exclude tags is obvious: only one type of tag may be used
for the trees of a buffer.  If both types of tags are used for trees,
how can Org-mode decide what to do with the unmarked trees?  

A corollary of this rule is that the other type of tag can only be
used in a subtree of the tagged tree in order to reverse the effect of
the tree-level tag, as in the following example.

#+begin_src org
  ,* Tree 1                                                             :export:
  ,   This is exported
  ,** Subtree 1                                                       :noexport:
  ,   This is not exported
  ,* Tree 2
  ,  This is not exported
  ,** Subtree 2
  ,  This is not exported, either
#+end_src
