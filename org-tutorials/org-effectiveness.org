* Introduction

In the Personal Software Process, we attend to the tasks in the
estimated time, but few times we attend to effectiveness,
understanding by effectiveness, the tasks done comparising the
proposed tasks.

The formal educative process try evaluate with respect to solve exams,
that is, quizes or another academic tests and some times training
exercises, although, few times the student knows if execute your own
personal objectives: what is the reason because I've started to study
something if I've learn it or don't. Finally, someone knows if learn
things because has been able to make. The idea presented in this
tutorial is a software to everyone can be evaluted to himself in
function to his own personal objectives. We can say that measure the
effectiveness is know if we are honest whith ourselves.

* Installation

Currently, org-effectiveness.el is stored in contrib, you can download worg with:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ cd ~
$ mkdir git
$ cd git
$ git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
#+END_SRC

You can find org-effectiveness.el in ~/git/org-mode/contrib/lisp

So, you can add the next line (or similar) in your .emacs
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(load "~/git/org-mode/contrib/lisp/org-effectiveness.el")
#+END_SRC

If you want use the plot feature, you must install gnuplot, for instance in debian, you can do:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ apt-get install gnuplot
#+END_SRC

* Counting outlines

To measure the effectiveness we can count tasks done and tasks
cancelled, but perhaps you want count the tasks pending or tasks in
another state, so we've built some functions to it.

With org-effectiveness-count-keyword, we can count an outline in an
state (keyword) given. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
M-x org-effectiveness-count-keyword TODO
#+END_SRC

Usually, anyone will be using the next states: TODO, CANCELED and DONE
at least, so we can use

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
M-x org-effectiveness-count-todo
M-x org-effectiveness-count-done
M-x org-effectiveness-count-canceled
#+END_SRC

* Effectiveness

The calculus that I propose to know if someones is effectiveness is
very simple is enough dividing the number of tasks DONE with the
CANCELED. So, we can know the total effectiveness in the current
buffer with:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
M-x org-effectiveness
#+END_SRC

We can know, the effectiveness in a specific date with 

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
M-x org-effectiveness-in-date
#+END_SRC

Writing the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

* Deploying graphs

We can deploy a gnuplot graph to know the effectiveness in the curren
buffer by months with:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
M-x org-effectiveness-plot
#+END_SRC
