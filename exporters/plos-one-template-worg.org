* Instructions for Use

This file provides a template to export an Org mode file to a LaTeX
file that meets the specifications of the open-access journal
[[http://www.plosone.org][/PLOS ONE/]]. It features:

 - environment setup with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Variables.html][Emacs local variables]];
 - [[http://orgmode.org/manual/The-Export-Dispatcher.html][asynchronous export]] to pdf via LaTeX;
 - [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure#Document_classes][custom document classes]] for article development and for submitting
   to the journal;
 - an optional [[http://www.plosone.org/static/supportingInformation][supporting information document]] capable of creating a
   [[http://biostats.bepress.com/bioconductor/paper2/][compendium]] in pdf format;
 - [[http://www.bibtex.org][BibTeX]] bibliography management with [[http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/][Ebib]]

These features are described in the following sections. In addition,
there is a [[Checklist][checklist]] to help guide you through configuration and
document preparation.

The template is distributed as =plos-one-template.org= at
https://github.com/tsdye/org-plos-one-template.git.

** Emacs Local Variables

The environment is set up with [[Local Variables][Emacs local variables]], which Emacs
requires be found near the end of the file.  

The following local variable lines initialize the Org mode LaTeX
exporter, indicate the name of the asynchronous export initialization
file, and then specify that asynchronous export should be used and
that the export process should leave data behind in case there are
problems.

#+begin_example
 # eval: (require 'ox-latex)
 # eval: (setq org-export-async-init-file (expand-file-name "init-plos.el"))
 # org-export-in-background: t 
 # org-export-async-debug: t 
#+end_example

The following local variable line provides compatibility across a
recent Org mode function name change.

#+begin_example
 # eval: (and (fboundp 'org-sbe) (not (fboundp 'sbe)) (fset 'sbe 'org-sbe))
#+end_example


The following local variable line executes [[Link Type for Citations][a source code block]] that
defines an Org mode link that functions to insert a bibliographic
reference.

#+begin_example
 # eval: (sbe "define-cite-link")
#+end_example


The final local variable line executes [[ebib-setup][a source code block]] that sets
up the [[http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/][Ebib]] BibTeX database manager.

#+begin_example
 # eval: (sbe "ebib-setup")
#+end_example

** Asynchronous Export

The /PLOS ONE/ template is set up to use the asynchronous Org mode
exporter, both for the article and for the optional supporting
information document.

To export the article with point anywhere in the Org mode buffer, type
=C-c C-e l o= or =C-c C-e l p=. The first of these will export a LaTeX
file, compile it with pdflatex, then attempt to open the resulting pdf
file. The second one does the same, but does not attempt to open the
pdf file.

To export the supporting information document, move point to the
[[Supporting Information Document]] heading and type =C-c C-e C-s l o= or
=C-c C-e C-s l p= to export the supporting information sub-tree.

** Custom Document Classes

The /PLOS ONE/ template includes two custom document classes named
=plos-devel= and =plos-submit=.  

The document class =plos-devel= can be used when the article is being
written. It includes figures in the exported document.

The document class =plos-submit= can be used to make the pdf file that
will be submitted to /PLOS ONE/. It includes figure captions, but does
not insert the figures. /PLOS ONE/ requires that figures be submitted
as separate tiff or eps format graphics files.

The document class is set near the top of the file, with
the =#+LATEX_CLASS:= property.  The default value set in the template
is =plos-devel=.  In most cases it is convenient to use this document
class until the article is complete and ready to be sent to the
journal. Then, the =#+LATEX_CLASS:= property can be changed to
=plos-submit= and the document exported in the usual way.

** Using Ebib for Citations

The file is set up to use Ebib for citations.  Ebib is a convenient
tool that uses Emacs for display, but otherwise operates
independently. You can learn how to use Ebib with its excellent [[http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/][user
manual]]. Please be aware that the current user manual is hosted on
github and that the old user manual, hosted on sourceforge, is what
Google finds. An easy way to tell them apart is the background color;
the old manual has a maroon background and the new one has a
bluish background. 

Ebib is set up to know about the default bibliography database,
local.bib. If you are used to working in a LaTeX environment and have
one or more bibliographic databases, you can choose either to transfer
entries from your own database to local.bib, or you can configure the
template to use more than one bibliographic database.  There are
instructions below on how to add a bibliographic database to the
template. 

You start Ebib with M-x ebib RET.  By default, you should see the
local.bib with a single entry. Ebib uses single keystrokes for
commands. Press =z= to lower Ebib and return to this document.

There are several ways to insert a reference into your document. The
first, and the one I use most often, is bound by the template to =C-c
b=. Ebib will prompt for the citation key to use, then for the
citation command, and finally, for Argument 1, which specifies how the
citation will look in the Org mode buffer.

The sequence =C-c b=, =sch TAB RET=, =c TAB RET=, =schulte= inserts
the following reference: [[cite:schulte12:_multi_languag_comput_envir_liter][schulte]].  Clicking on the link will take you
to the entry of local.bib.  Press =z= in Ebib to return to this document.

*** Adding Another BibTeX Database

 - [ ] Add the database name to the [[end-matter][LaTeX =\bibliography= command]]
 - [ ] If you are making a  [[http://biostats.bepress.com/bioconductor/paper2/][compendium]], add the database name to the
   [[compendium-contents][compendium contents table]]
 - [ ] Modify the [[ebib-setup][Ebib setup code]] and execute the source code block

** Figures

/PLOS ONE/ has a [[http://www.plosone.org/static/figureGuidelines#titles][detailed specification for figures]].  You are
encouraged to read it carefully.  In particular, you'll need to
produce either =tiff= or =eps= files to submit to the journal.

If you are planning to distribute a  [[http://biostats.bepress.com/bioconductor/paper2/][compendium]] with your paper, then
you will want to develop the figures in the [[Supporting Information Document][supporting information
document]] section, so the code involved in their construction can be
easily packaged.

The figures for the paper are inserted in the [[Figure Legends][section for figure
legends]], in the usual Org mode way.

I develop the paper using the =#+LATEX_CLASS:= plos-devel and insert
the figures as LaTeX-friendly =pdf= or =jpg= files.  This way I can
see that the figures are right with their captions and I can
distribute the draft paper to colleagues as a single =pdf= document
with figures.

When it is time to submit to the journal, I switch the =#+LATEX_CLASS=
to plos-submit, which removes the figures, but leaves the figure
captions.  At that time, the LaTeX-friendly figures can be converted
to either =tiff= or =eps= format for the journal.

** /PLOS ONE/ Supporting Information Document

/PLOS ONE/ will accept a  [[http://biostats.bepress.com/bioconductor/paper2/][compendium]] in =pdf= format as Supporting
Information. The template supports this effort by partially populating
two tables, one that lists the [[open-source-software][software used to produce the paper]] and
the other that includes [[compendium-contents][links to graphic and other files]] archived
within the =pdf= file. 

** Checklist [0/10]                                 

  - [ ] Save this file as the file name of your choice, e.g., myarticle.org.
  - [ ] Configure the [[export-setup-plos-one][PLOS ONE initialization files]]
  - [ ] Tangle the initialization files by [[elisp:(sbe "tangle-init-file")][clicking here]]
  - [ ] Complete the [[author-table][author table]]
  - [ ] Possibly configure the [[end-matter][bibliography command]], or just use the
    default local.bib
  - [ ] Possibly configure the [[Supporting Information Document][supporting information document]] EXPORT_TITLE
    property to reflect the title of your article 
  - [ ] Prepare a [[Striking Image][striking image]]
  - [ ] Prepare a [[PLOS-One Instructions for Cover Letter][cover letter]]
  - [ ] Optionally, export the supporting information document by
    pressing =C-c C-e C-s l o= with the point in the [[Supporting
    Information Document][supporting information document]] headline
  - [ ] Export the article, by pressing =C-c C-e l o= anywhere in the document

** PLOS-One Instructions for Cover Letter [0/7]                   
You should supply an approximately one page cover letter that:

 - [ ] Concisely summarizes why your paper is a valuable addition to the
   scientific literature
 - [ ] Briefly relates your study to previously published work
 - [ ] Specifies the type of article you are submitting (for example,
   research article, systematic review, meta-analysis, clinical trial)
 - [ ] Describes any prior interactions with PLOS regarding the submitted
   manuscript
 - [ ] Suggests appropriate /PLOS ONE/ Academic Editors to handle your
   manuscript ([[http://www.plosone.org/static/edboard][view a complete listing of our academic editors]])
 - [ ] Lists any recommended or opposed reviewers
 - [ ] Your cover letter should not include requests to reduce or waive
   publication fees. Should your manuscript be accepted, you will have
   the opportunity to include your requests at that time. See PLOS ONE
   Editorial Policy for more information regarding publication fees.
* Striking Image                                                  

#+begin_quote
Authors are encouraged to upload a "striking image" that may be used
to represent their paper online in places like the journal homepage or
in search results. The striking image must be derived from a figure or
supporting information file from the paper, ie. a cropped portion of
an image or the entire image. Striking images should ideally be high
resolution, eye-catching, single panel images, and should ideally
avoid containing added details such as text, scale bars, and arrows.
If no striking image is uploaded, a figure from the paper will be
designated as the striking image.
#+end_quote

* Author Table 

The =author-table= holds information on the authors and their
affiliations.  It is assembled and placed on the title page by [[plos-one-start][this
Emacs lisp source code block]].  Most of the column names should be
self-explanatory. The =Corresponding= column should have "yes" or "no"
entries that indicate whether or not the author is the corresponding
author.

#+name: author-table
| Author name | Department | Institution | City | State | Country | Email | Corresponding |
|-------------+------------+-------------+------+-------+---------+-------+---------------|


*NOTE* Do not add, delete, or change the position of a column in the
=author-table=.  The [[plos-one-start][simple-minded code]] that processes the
table will be confused if you do.

** Link Type for Citations

The following source code block defines a cite: link type.  The cite
links will be inserted into the Org mode document by Ebib.  When the
Org mode file is exported to LaTeX, a =\cite= command is inserted into
the LaTeX file. This is the only type of citation allowed by the /PLOS
ONE/ style.

** Preamble Source Code

The source code block =plos-one-start= is called before the first
headline. It takes information from the =author-table= and creates a
title page that meets the following [[http://www.plosone.org/static/guidelines#format][/PLOS ONE/ specification]]:

#+begin_quote
The title, authors, and affiliations should all be included on a title
page as the first page of the manuscript file.

** Ebib Setup

This source code block initializes Ebib and binds =C-c b= to the
command that inserts the =cite:= link.  It instructs Ebib to look for
the BibTeX database, =local.bib=, in the current directory and puts
=local.bib= on the list of local BibTeX file names.  The last line
defines the command that inserts the =cite:= link.  

#+name: ebib-setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (autoload 'ebib "ebib" "Ebib, a BibTeX database manager." t)
  (dolist (hook '(org-mode-hook))
    (add-hook hook (lambda () (local-set-key "\C-cb" 'ebib-insert-bibtex-key))))
  (setq ebib-bib-search-dirs (quote ("./")))
  (setq ebib-preload-bib-files (quote ("local.bib")))
  (setq ebib-local-bibtex-filenames (quote ("local.bib")))
  (setq ebib-citation-commands
        (quote ((org-mode (("cite" "[[cite:%K][%A]]"))))))
#+end_src

If you want to add another BibTeX database to the setup, then you
might need to modify this code in three places.  For example, to also
load a database named =main.bib= that is found in the =biblio= folder
of the user's home directory:

#+begin_example
  (setq ebib-bib-search-dirs (quote ("./" "~/biblio")))
  (setq ebib-preload-bib-files (quote ("local.bib" "main.bib")))
  (setq ebib-local-bibtex-filenames (quote ("local.bib" "main.bib")))
#+end_example
