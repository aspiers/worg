This tutorial describes the necessary steps to produce beautiful
letters using Org-mode's LaTeX exporter and KOMA-Script's =scrlttr2=
class.

* DONE Quick start guide

** DONE Requirements

The code in this tutorial depends on the following:

- Org-mode version 8.0 or greater.
- A LaTeX installation including KOMA-Script, e.g., [[http://www.tug.org/texlive/][TeX Live]].

*Note*: The information in this tutorial depends on functionality that
has not yet been released. You can either [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#keeping-current-with-Org-mode-development][use the latest development
version from the Org-mode git repository]] or [[http://orgmode.org/cgit.cgi/org-mode.git/plain/contrib/lisp/ox-koma-letter.el][download a current version
of the KOMA letter exporter]] and install it in =contrib/lisp=.

** DONE Minimal configuration of the KOMA letter exporter

To use the KOMA letter exporter, you have to add it to Emacs' load
path, activate it, and configure a LaTeX class for the LaTeX exporter
(the KOMA letter exporter uses the LaTeX exporter internally).

1. Add the path containing =ox-koma-letter.el= to Emacs' load
   path. For example, if you use the version contained in the
   directory =contrib/lisp= of Org-mode, add the following to your
   Emacs configuration:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/org-mode/contrib/lisp" t)
   #+END_SRC

2. Activate the KOMA letter exporter by adding the following to your
   Emacs configuration:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (require 'ox-koma-letter)
   #+END_SRC

3. <<letter-class-definition>> Configure a LaTeX class for the LaTeX
   exporter to use for the export of KOMA letters by adding the
   following to your Emacs configuration:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
             '("my-letter"
               "\\documentclass\{scrlttr2\}
\\usepackage[english]{babel}
\[NO-DEFAULT-PACKAGES]
\[NO-PACKAGES]
\[EXTRA]"))
   #+END_SRC

   For more information about this step, refer to the documentation of
   the variables [[http://orgmode.org/worg/doc.html#org-latex-classes][org-latex-classes]], [[http://orgmode.org/worg/doc.html#org-latex-default-packages-alist][org-latex-default-packages-alist]],
   and [[http://orgmode.org/worg/doc.html#org-latex-packages-alist][org-latex-packages-alist]].

** DONE A simple letter example

Printed below is a minimal Org file that can be exported to a KOMA
letter. In this file, press =C-c C-e= to bring up the exporter
dispatcher and then press =k o= to export the Org file to a PDF file
containing the letter. For your convenience, you can [[http://orgmode.org/worg/sources/exporters/koma-letter-example.org][download the KOMA
letter example]] and you can also [[http://orgmode.org/worg/images/ox-koma-letter/koma-letter-example.pdf][download the example PDF letter]].

#+INCLUDE: "koma-letter-example.org" src org

The first line selects the [[letter-class-definition][letter LaTeX class]] we defined above. The
following lines configure the letter's sender and recipient and other
information of the letter. These settings are described in the next
section. Finally, the content of the letter is written as plain text.

* DONE Configuration guide

In addition to the actual content a typical letter also contains
additional information, such as the sender's and recipient's
addresses, a date, and so on. From now on we refer to this additional
data as /letter metadata/.

A special group of letter metadata control the appearance of the
letter, such as the presence of foldmarks or a back address. These are
called /letter options/.

** DONE Setting letter metadata and letter options

Letter metadata can be configured in one of three ways, listed below
from the most specific to the most general:

1. Using Org option lines, as show in the [[*A%20simple%20letter%20example][simple letter example]] above,
2. By setting Emacs variables, or
3. In a KOMA-Script Letter Class Option file (LCO file).

It is also possible to define multiple LaTeX classes for different
letters in addition to the [[letter-class-definition][letter LaTeX class]] shown above. For
example, one could have separate classes for private and business
letters.

*** DONE Setting letter metadata in Org option lines

The simplest way to set letter metadata is by using Org option lines
as used in the [[*A%20simple%20letter%20example][simple letter example]] above. In the example, these
lines are used to set the subject and the date of the letter, the
sender's and the recipient's addresses, the opening and closing lines
of the letter, and, finally, the sender's signature.

Note that the first option line, =#+LATEX_CLASS: my-letter=, does not
set letter metadata but instead is used to select the [[letter-class-definition][letter LaTeX
class]] we defined above. /The/ =#+LATEX_CLASS:= /option line is
mandatory for the KOMA letter exporter./

Letter options are set using an =#+OPTIONS:= line in the same manner
as other [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Export-options.html][Org mode export options]].

A full [[*List%20of%20KOMA%20letter%20meta%20data%20settings][list of KOMA letter metadata settings]] is provided below.

Setting letter metadata by Org option lines take precedence over the
other two ways of setting letter metadata. Thus, you can set default
letter metadata using Emacs variables or in an LCO file (see below)
and overwrite these defaults for an individual letter using Org option
lines.

If you define a letter below an Org heading, you must use Org
properties inside a =:PROPERTIES:= drawer and prefix every option
property with the string =EXPORT_=. See the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Export-options.html][chapter Export options in
the Org manual]] for details.

*** DONE Setting letter metadata in Emacs variables

Letter metadata can also be set using Emacs variables. For example,
the Emacs Lisp snippet below sets the letter's closing line:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-koma-letter-closing "See you soon,")
#+END_SRC

A full [[*List%20of%20KOMA%20letter%20meta%20data%20settings][list of KOMA letter metadata settings]] is provided below.

Letter metadata set by Emacs variables take precedence over letter
metadata defined in LCO files but can be overwritten for an
individual letter (or a file) by [[*Setting%20letter%20meta%20data%20in%20Org%20option%20lines][setting letter metadata in Org
option lines]].

*** DONE Setting letter metadata in LCO files

As a third way, letter metadata can be set in so-called letter class
option files (LCO files) . LCO files are regular TeX files which are
included in the TeX source of the letter. Consequently, one has access
to the entirety of KOMA options in LCO files and can also include
other LaTeX code. For more information about LCO files, see the
[[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script][KOMA-Script documentation]].

LCO files are set by the =#+LCO:= option line or the Emacs variable
=org-koma-letter-class-option-file=. KOMA-Script comes with a variety
of pre-made LCO files, such as =DIN= for German letters, =NF= for
French letters, or =UScommercial9= for US-American letters.

Letter metadata set in LCO files can be overwritten globally by
[[*Setting%20letter%20meta%20data%20in%20Emacs%20variables][setting letter metadata in Emacs variables]] or for an individual
letter or file by [[*Setting%20letter%20meta%20data%20in%20Org%20option%20lines][setting letter metadata in Org option lines]].

LCO files are especially convenient for setting letter metadata which
is fairly constant across multiple letters, e.g., the sender's address
and banking information.

The following LCO file, called =DefaultAddress.lco=, sets the default
address. It can loaded using the Org option line =#+LCO:Â DefaultAddress= 
(without the =.lco= extension).

#+BEGIN_SRC latex :exports code
% Default letter configuration file
\ProvidesFile{DefaultAddress.lco}

% Default address
\setkomavar{fromname}{Jane Doe}
\setkomavar{fromaddress}{Some Street 1\\12345 Some City}
\setkomavar{fromemail}{jane.doe@email.com}
\setkomavar{fromphone}{(555) 526-3363}
\setkomavar{signature}{\usekomavar{fromname}}
#+END_SRC

The following LCO file, called =Banking.lco=, configures a footer with
banking information. To load it together with the default address
defined above one can use the Org option line =#+LCO: DefaultAddress
Banking=.

#+BEGIN_SRC latex :exports code
% Banking information configuration file
\ProvidesFile{Banking.lco}

% Banking information in the footer
\setkomavar{frombank}{Jane Doe\\Account number: 12\,345\,678\\Somebank\\Bank code number: 876\,543\,21}
\setkomavar{firstfoot}{% 
  \footnotesize
  \parbox[b]{\linewidth}{%
    \centering\def\\{ \textbullet{} }\usekomavar{frombank}% 
  }%
}
#+END_SRC

Custom LCO files must be placed in a directory where LaTeX will find
them. On Linux, this defaults to =~/texmf/tex/latex=. On OS X, use
=~/Library/texmf/tex/latex= instead. These paths can be configured
using the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
tlmgr conf texmf TEXMFHOME /some/path
#+END_SRC

You can test whether =foo.lco= is recognized by TeX Live by running
the commmand =kpsewhich foo.lco=. After adding a file to the TeX Live
path you may have to run =mktexlsr=.

This section lists all Org option lines, Emacs variables, and the
corresponding KOMA variables or options that control the behavior of
the KOMA letter exporter.

*** DONE List of KOMA letter metadata

*** DONE List of KOMA letter options

The following letter options can be set in an =#+OPTIONS:= line. In
general, they correspond to a LaTeX command such as:

#+BEGIN_SRC latex :exports code
\KOMAoption{<KOMA option>}{<value>}
#+END_SRC

* Footnotes

[fn:1] If the letter is exported below an Org headline, the default
subject contains the Org headline text.

[fn:2] The options lines =#+FROM_ADDRESS:= and =#+TO_ADDRESS:= can be
used multiple times.

[fn:3] The recipient's address must be different for every
letter. Therefore one cannot set a default value using Emacs variables
or LCO files.

[fn:4] The options lines =#+OPENING:= and =#+CLOSING:= cannot be set
in an LCO file.

[fn:5] See the [[http://www.komascript.de/][KOMA script documentation]] for a list of accepted
values.
