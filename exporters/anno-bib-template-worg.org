#+TITLE: Annotated Bibliography Template
#+AUTHOR: Thomas S. Dye
#+EMAIL: tsd at tsdye dot com

* Introduction
This file describes a template for creating an annotated bibliography
document using Org mode. The document is intended to be output as a
pdf file and distributed as printed hard copy.  

The template is distributed as =annotate-biblio-template.org= at
https://github.com/tsdye/org-bib-template.git. 
 
An example of its use can be found in the files =14c-workshop.org= and
=local.bib=, also at https://github.com/tsdye/org-bib-template.git.

The goal was to design a template that makes an annotated bibiliography
  - easy to build,
  - good looking, and
  - organized by topical sections and subsections.

The template relies on a working LaTeX installation that includes
several common LaTeX packages, and a database manager for Emacs (table
[[software-requirements]]).

In the Org mode file, the first three heading levels are reserved for
topics and sub-topics. Bibliographic entries are placed on fourth
level headings. The following example shows two fourth level
headlines; the first fourth level heading shows what the buffer looks
like when Org mode is using =descriptive links= and the second is when
Org mode is using =literal links=.

#+name: first-eg
#+begin_example
,* Topic
,** Sub-topic
,*** Sub-sub-topic
,**** ;;Bayliss Revolution
,**** [[cite:bayliss09:_rollin_out_revol][;;Bayliss Revolution]]
#+end_example

* Workflow
First, you should set the =#+TITLE:=, =#+AUTHOR:=, and =#+EMAIL:=
keyword values.

#+begin_example
,#+TITLE: Your Title
,#+AUTHOR: Your Name
,#+EMAIL: Your email
#+end_example

I like to organize my annotated bibliographies the same way I've
learned to organize projects in Org mode; I make an outline of topics
and subtopics using first, second, and third level headings as
necessary. Then I write whatever comes to mind for each of the
headings. From then on, I insert bibliographic entries, annotate them,
and revise topic and sub-topic text accordingly.

Bibliographic entries are inserted as fourth level headings,
regardless of the heading level immediately preceding them.  Thus, the
following example will work just as well as the [[first-eg][earlier example]]:

#+name: first-eg
#+begin_example
,* Topic
,**** ;;Bayliss Revolution
#+end_example

Over the years, my colleagues and I have created a master bibliography
with more than 4,000 entries. This is a bit unwieldy to distribute, so
I like to make a local bibliography that only contains the entries
that appear in the annotated bibliography and that can be easily
distributed. One way to do this, and the way that I prefer, is to open
the master database and a local database in [[http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/][Ebib]] and then copy entries
from master to local as the annotated bibliography is being written.
This is simply achieved by [[http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/ebib-manual.html#exporting-entries][exporting entries from one Ebib database to
another]].

Adding a bibliographic entry involves creating the fourth level
headline and then pressing =C-c C-b= to insert the citation. [[http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/ebib-manual.html][Ebib]] will
prompt for the bibliographic key, and then for three strings---one for
the post-entry text, another for the pre-entry text, and finally one for
the entry's description in the Org mode buffer. Typically, for an
annotated bibliography the first two strings are empty. 

Once that is done you should have a cite link as a fourth level
headline, leaving you ready to annotate.

* Options and Keywords

The following example of options and keywords is one that I used
recently for an annotated bibliography of radiocarbon dating in
Hawai`i. The =#+OPTIONS:= line lists options in order of descending
importance. The option =h:4= ensures that headings include LaTeX
paragraphs, which are used to typeset the bibliographic entries. The
option =toc:3= puts all headings above the bibliographic entries into
the table of contents. Depending on how much detail you want in the
table of contents, this could sensibly be set to =toc:2= or =toc:1=.
Or, for a simple bibliography, even =toc:nil=.  The options =tags:nil=
and =todo:nil= ensure that none of the Org mode metadata attached to
headings makes it into the exported document. The last two options are
useful for LaTeX export; I like =^:{}= because my BibTeX keys are
configured to use underscores and I don't want parts of the keys
rendered in the Org mode buffer as subscripts.

#+name: ante-matter
#+begin_example
,#+OPTIONS: h:4 toc:3 tags:nil todo:nil ':t ^:{}
,#+LATEX_CLASS: koma-article
,#+LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [paper=letter,oneside,DIV=8]
,#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[style=verbose,backend=bibtex]{biblatex}
,#+LATEX_HEADER: \addbibresource{local.bib}
,#+STARTUP: entitiespretty
#+end_example

The =#+LATEX_CLASS:= keyword needs to match the class name defined
[[Koma Article][below]].

The =#+LATEX_CLASS_OPTIONS:= keyword can take any option described in
the [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script][Koma Script]] manual. The options shown in [[ante-matter][the example]]: set the paper
size to letter paper (Europeans might want to use =a4= here, or simply
get rid of the option to use the default, which is =a4=); formats for
single-sided output, which is good for a bibliography that will be
bound with a stable at the top left corner; and uses =DIV= to
calculate the type area of the page.  Longer and more complex
bibliographies that will be distributed with a binding might want to
use the =twoside= option. The integer value of the =DIV= option
determines the size of the type area; larger integers increase the
size of the type area.

The two =#+LATEX_HEADER:= keywords are included here, rather than in
the definition of [[Koma%20Article][koma-article]], because they are likely to change from
one annotated bibliography to the next.  In general, the =biblatex=
package will always use the =verbose= style, but the backend will
depend on which of BibTeX or Biber you are accustomed to using.  The
second =#+LATEX_HEADER= specifies the name of the bibliographic
database that holds entries for the works that appear in the annotated
bibliography. 

The last line, which starts up Org mode with =entitiespretty= is just
a personal preference for the look of the buffer.

* User Entities
The following source code block sets up user entities that are used frequently
in my work. I use the various =.*macron= commands to typeset Hawaiian
language words with what is known in Hawaiian as a /kahak\omacron{}/.

The =space= entity is useful following a period that doesn't end a
sentence. LaTeX sets a space slightly longer than an inter-word space
following a sentence ending period. The =space= entity lets LaTeX know
to set an inter-word space.

#+name: user-entities
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-entities-user nil)
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("space" "\\ " nil " " " " " " "–"))
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("amacron" "\\={a}" nil "&#0257" "a" "a" "ā"))
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("emacron" "\\={e}" nil "&#0275" "e" "e" "ē"))
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("imacron" "\\={\\i}" nil "&#0299" "i" "i" "ī"))
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("omacron" "\\={o}" nil "&#0333" "o" "o" "ō"))
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("umacron" "\\={u}" nil "&#0363" "u" "u" "ū"))
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("Amacron" "\\={A}" nil "&#0256" "A" "A" "Ā"))
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("Emacron" "\\={E}" nil "&#0274" "E" "E" "Ē"))
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("Imacron" "\\={I}" nil "&#0298" "I" "I" "Ī"))
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("Omacron" "\\={O}" nil "&#0332" "O" "O" "Ō"))
  (add-to-list 'org-entities-user '("Umacron" "\\={U}" nil "&#0362" "U" "U" "Ū"))
#+end_src
* LaTeX Process
The Org mode variable =org-latex-pdf-process= holds a list of strings,
each of which is run as a shell command. Typically, several commands
are needed to process a LaTeX document to produce pdf output. The
following two source code blocks use a straightforward approach that
should work in most cases. The source code block named
[[set-pdf-process-bibtex][set-pdf-process-bibtex]] uses [[http://www.bibtex.org/Using/][BibTeX]] to process the bibliography. BibTeX
has been a standard for many years in the LaTeX world. The source code
block named [[set-pdf-process-biber][set-pdf-process-biber]] uses a newer bibliography processor
named [[http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/][Biber]], which is designed to work with [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex][BibLaTeX]].  The choice of
which one to use must be reflected in the =usepackage= command for
BibLaTeX at the top of this file; the optional command =backend= takes
either =bibtex= or =biber= as its value.

At a practical level, perhaps the main difference between Biber and
BibTeX is how they handle special characters. The bibliographic
database for BibTeX uses LaTeX commands for special characters while
the database for Biber uses UTF-8 characters.

#+name: set-pdf-process-bibtex
#+header: :results silent
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-latex-pdf-process
        '("pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
          "bibtex %b"
          "pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
          "pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))
#+end_src

#+name: set-pdf-process-biber
#+header: :results silent
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq org-latex-pdf-process
        '("pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
          "biber %b"
          "pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
          "pdflatex -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))
#+end_src

* Cite Link
There are many ways to manage citations in Org mode. My preference is
to manage the bibliography database with [[http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/][Ebib: a BibTeX database
manager for Emacs]] and insert citations using a custom Org mode link. I
find the work flow convenient and the look of the Org mode buffer
"good enough."

The source code block named [[ebib-setup][ebib-setup]] defines a cite command that
[[http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/][Ebib]] will use to insert citations in an Org mode buffer. It inserts
the BibTeX key as the path part of the link and then offers the user
three prompts to enter strings separated by semi-colons as the
description part of the link. The first of these typically holds a
page number, the second holds a string that appears before the in-text
citation (typically, something like "e.g.,"), and the third is the
description of the citation visible in the Org mode buffer.

The source code block named [[define-biblatex-cite-link][define-biblatex-cite-link]] defines an Org
mode link type that parses the link inserted by [[http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/][Ebib]] and outputs a
correctly formatted LaTeX citation. In theory, it is possible also to
export correctly formatted citations to other backends, but the link
type defined here doesn't do that. The html export simply sandwiches
the BibTeX key between =<cite>= tags and is included here as a
placeholder for future development.

#+name: ebib-setup
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq ebib-citation-commands
        (quote ((any (("cite" "\\cite%<[%A]%>{%K}")))
                (org-mode (("cite" "[[cite:%K][%A;%A;%A]]"))))))
#+end_src

#+name: define-biblatex-cite-link
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :results silent
  (org-add-link-type 
   "cite" 'ebib
   (lambda (path desc format)
     (cond
      ((eq format 'html)
       (format "(<cite>%s</cite>)" path))
      ((eq format 'latex)
       (if (or (not desc) (equal 0 (search "cite:" desc)))
           (format "\\cite{%s}" path)
         (format "\\cite[%s][%s]{%s}"
                 (cadr (split-string desc ";"))
                 (car (split-string desc ";"))  path))))))
#+end_src

* Koma Article
The following two source code blocks set up a LaTeX class named
=koma-article= that is referenced near the top of the file. The
=koma-article= class is based on the [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script][Koma script]] article class
=scrartcl=, which uses a sans-serif font for headings and a serif font
for body text.

The =koma-article= class uses fonts from the [[http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/][TeX Gyre collection of
fonts]]. As explained in [[http://www.gust.org.pl/projects/e-foundry/tex-gyre/tb87hagen-gyre.pdf][The New Font Project: TeX Gyre]], a goal of the
project was to produce good quality fonts with diacritical characters
sufficient to cover all European languages as well as Vietnamese and
Navajo. 

The source code block named [[koma-article-times][koma-article-times]] is based on the Times
Roman font. The serif Termes font is a replacement for Times Roman,
the sans-serif Heros font is a replacement for Helvetica, and the
typewriter Cursor font is a replacement for Courier. The source code
block named [[koma-article-palatino][koma-article-palatino]] is based on the beautiful Palatino
font designed by Hermann Zapf. The Pagella font is the TeX Gyre
replacement for Palatino. Typographers often recommend that
linespacing be increased slightly with Palatino, and this has been
achieved with the addition of the =linespacing= command.

The Tex Gyre fonts benefit from the [[http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/microtype][microtype package]], which provides
"subliminal refinements towards typographical perfection," including
"character protrusion and font expansion, furthermore the adjustment
of inter-word spacing and additional kerning, as well as hyphenatable
letter spacing (tracking) and the possibility to disable all or
selected ligatures."

In addition, the [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/paralist/][paralist package]] is used for its compact versions of
the LaTeX list environments.

Finally, the =newcommand= is provided merely as an illustration of one
way to move LaTeX declarations out of the Org file header. This one is
useful in my work as an archaeologist and over the years it has crept
into my BibTeX database. It shouldn't interfere with your work, but
you might want to remove it or replace it with LaTeX commands that you
do frequently use.

#+name: koma-article-times
#+header: :results silent
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (require 'ox-latex)
   (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
                '("koma-article"
                  "\\documentclass{scrartcl}

                   \\newcommand{\\rc}{$^{14}C$}"
                  ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                  ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                  ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                  ("\\paragraph{%s}" . "\\paragraph*{%s}")
                  ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}")))

                  ("\\subparagraph{%s}" . "\\subparagraph*{%s}")))
#+end_src

* Local variables

The [[local-vars-eg][local variables]] call the source code blocks defined earlier to set
up the export environment. When the file
=annotated-biblio-template.org= is opened, Emacs will prompt to allow
the local variables to be executed.

The first call creates an alias for the =org-sbe= function, so that
the old name for this function, =sbe=, will also be recognized.

The second call selects Times New Roman as the serif font.
Alternately, this could be replaced by a call to
"koma-article-palatino".

The third call sets up user entities.

The fourth call sets up the Org mode pdf process to use BibTeX. If you
want to use Biber, instead, you should call "set-pdf-process-biber".

The fifth and sixth calls set up ebib to insert links into the Org
mode buffer and instruct Org mode how to use those links to create
LaTeX citations.
