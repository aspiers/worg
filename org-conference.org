This page gathers ideas and plans for a possible Org-mode conference.

#+index: Conferences

* List ideas of things we would do there

* Find out what would be the best location/date


Suggestion: hold it jointly (or with some overlap) with one of the [[http://www.gnu.org/ghm/][GNU
Hackers meetings]]

Many GNU people at the GHMs are heavy org users.  We try to organise
our meetings with (1) a local hackspace and (2) colocated with another
free software conference.

The past 2 years we had 3 day meetings before FSCONS 2009 in
Gothenburg with the Gnutiken Hackspace and before GUADEC 2010 with the
Revelation Hackspace in Den Haag.

* Figure out how much money does it requires

* Decide (or not) to go for it

* Raise money through donations and grants (e.g. from the FSF)
