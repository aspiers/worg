The Org mailing list is an English language forum for discussing Org.
It is used by the diverse community of Org developers, maintainers,
contributors, experienced users, and new and prospective users both
for discussion and as a repository of information. It was established
by the creator of Org-mode, Carsten Dominik, who enjoys the different
perspectives and range of interests expressed there.

The list is less formal and more diverse than a site like
[[http://stackoverflow.com/tags/org-mode/info][stackoverflow]], which has an org-mode section. Subscribers' messages to
the list aren't moderated and there is no formal mechanism to rate
questions, answers, or reputations.

List etiquette encourages posters to be precise, concise, and
friendly.  Lengthy excerpts of quoted material are probably redundant
and they clog certain distribution channels.  Posters should include
enough quoted material to establish the context for their comments and
cut away the rest.

The [[http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode][Org mailing list]] is very active.  You can browse it at

* Statistics (as of sept. 19th 2010)
  
** Scope and method

Here are a few stats that I computed from the [[ftp://lists.gnu.org/emacs-orgmode/][lists.gnu.org]] server
archives.

I concatenated the archives into one single mbox file, then I used a
small utility called [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusStats][gnus-stat.el]].
