Org-mode is a highly customizable package.  It currently contains
close to 400 customization variables that can be changed to tweak
every detail.  Such a large number is clearly intimidating to new
users.

Therefore, on this page, we have compiled a structured list of
variables that are [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-customization-survey.php][changed by many users]].  This list is meant as a
staring point.  If you start setting up Org-mode for your needs, first
look at the variables mentioned here.  However, never forget that
there are many more options, and that the Emacs customization system
organizes all these variables into a structure that can be used to
easily [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-customize.php][find the one particular option]] you might be looking for.  Also,
the [[http://orgmode.org/manual/][Org-mode manual]] and the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.php][FAQ]] mention many variables in the
appropriate places.

* Frequently customized Variables

** Basic setup

Org-mode can be used without any setup.  However, here are a few things
about basic setup that many people change.

- org-directory :: Where are my Org files typically located?
     This is not used often, but it is good to choose a directory for
     the bulk of your Org files.

- org-agenda-files :: Which files do I want to be checked for entries
     when compiling my agenda?  Many people do not customize this one,
     but just use =C-c [= and =C-c ]= to add or remove the current
     file, respectively.

- org-startup-folded :: When visiting an Org file, in what folding
     state do I first want to see it?  Many use =#+STARTUP= options to
     set this on a per-file basis.

- org-archive-location :: When archiving an entry, where will it go?

** Editing behavior and appearance

Besides being an organizer, Org-mode is also a text mode for writing
and taking notes.  The following variables that influence basic
editing behavior and the appearance of the buffer are often
customized:

- org-hide-leading-stars :: Make the outline more list-like be hiding
     all leading stars but one.

- org-odd-levels-only :: Should 2 stars be added per level?  This
     makes the indentation more like in a book.

- org-special-ctrl-a/e :: Should =C-a= and =C-e= behave specially,
     considering the headline and not the leading stars, todo
     keywords, or the trailing tags?  About equal numbers of users set
     this to =t= or to =reversed=

- org-special-ctrl-k :: Should =C-k= behave specially in headlines,
     considering tags and visibility state?

- org-completion-use-ido :: Should /ido.el/ be used for completion
     whenever it makes sense?

- org-return-follows-link :: Should pressing RET on a hyperlink follow
     the link?  People who are used to this from web browsers often
     make this choice.

- org-blank-before-new-entry :: Org-mode tries to be smart about
     inserting blank lines before new entries/items, by looking at
     what is before the previous entry/item.  Customize this to
     out-smart it.

** The TODO keywords

- org-todo-keywords :: Which TODO keywords should be used?  Also you
     can define keys for fast access here.  Very many people use this,
     or define the keywords with a =#+TODO:= setting in the buffer.

- org-todo-keyword-faces :: Here you can define different faces for
     different TODO keywords.

- org-enforce-todo-dependencies :: Should unfinished children block
     state changes in the parent?

- org-enforce-todo-checkbox-dependencies :: Should unfinished
     checkboxes block state changes in the parent?

** Tags

- org-tag-alist :: Which tags should be available?  Note that tags
     besides the configured one can be used, but for the important
     ones you can define keys for fast access here.

- org-tags-column :: How should tags be aligned in the headline?

- org-fast-tag-selection-single-key :: Set this to make the tags
     interface even faster, if all you normally do is changing a single
     tag.

** Progress logging

- org-log-done :: Do you want to capture time stamps and/or notes when
     TODO state changes, in particular when a task is DONE?  A simple
     setting that many use is =(setq org-log-done 'time)=.

** Remember and Refile

- org-reverse-note-order :: When adding new entries (or tasks) to a
     list, do I want the entry to be first or last in the list?

/Remember/ is great for fast capture of ideas, notes, and tasks.  It
is one of the primary capture methods in Org-mode.

- org-remember-templates :: Prepare templates for the typical notes
     and tasks you want to capture quickly using remember.  I believe
     everyone using /Remember/ with Org customizes this.  Don't forget
     to also call =org-remember-insinuate= in your startup file.

- org-default-notes-file :: If you do not set up templates with target
     files, at least tell Org where to put captured notes.

/Refiling/ means moving entries around, for example from a capturing
location to the correct project.

- org-refile-targets :: What should be on the menu when you refile
     tasks with =C-c C-w=?

- org-refile-use-outline-path :: How would you like to select refile
     targets. Headline only, or the path along the outline hierarchy?


** Agenda Views

- org-agenda-start-on-weekday :: Should the agenda start on Monday, or
     better today?

- org-agenda-ndays :: How many days should the default agenda show?
     Default is 7, a whole week.

- org-agenda-include-diary :: Should the agenda also show entries from
     the Emacs diary?

- org-agenda-custom-commands :: Define your own agenda commands.
     Complex, advanced variable, but pretty much everyone ends up
     configuring it.  Use customize to configure it, this is the best
     and safest way.  Do checkout [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-custom-agenda-commands.php][this tutorial]] on building your own
     custom agenda commands as well.

- org-agenda-sorting-strategy :: How should things be sorted in the
     agenda display.  Even though I think the defaults are very usable,
     power users tend to tweak this.

- org-stuck-projects :: How to find projects that need attention?

To reduce clutter in the tasks list for today, many users like to
remove tasks from the daily list right when they are done.  The
following variables give detailed control to what kind of entries this
should apply:

- org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done :: Scheduled entries.  Many users
     turn this on.

- org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done  :: Deadlines.  Many users turn
     this on.

- org-agenda-skip-timestamp-if-done :: Entries with any timestamp,
     appointments just like scheduled and deadline entries.
     Relatively few users select this one.

People who use Org like a day planner, who schedule all tasks to
specific dates, often like to not have scheduled tasks listed in their
global TODO list, because scheduling it already means to have taking
care of it in a sense, and because they know they will run into these
tasks in the agenda anyway.

- org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines :: Don't show deadline tasks in
     global TODO list.

- org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date :: Don't show any tasks with a date
     in the global TODO list.

- org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled :: Don't show scheduled tasks
     in the global TODO list.

** Export/Publishing setup

- org-export-with-LaTeX-fragments :: Should LaTeX fragments be
     converted to inline images for HTML output?

- org-export-html-style :: Customize the default style for HTML
     export.

- org-publish-project-alist :: Set up projects that allow many files
     to be exported and published with a single command.

** Clock setup

/Clocking/ is to measure the time spent on tasks and projects.  People
who intensively use this system tend to customize these variables:

- org-clock-persist :: Save and restore clock information between
     Emacs sessions.  This also needs a call to
     =org-clock-persistence-insinuate= in your startup file.

- org-clock-in-resume :: Should a previously running clock be resumed
     when entering a new Emacs session?

- org-clock-in-switch-to-state :: Should the TODO state change
     automatically when clocking in?

- org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks :: This makes a lot of sense,
     but is too magic if you are not prepared.
