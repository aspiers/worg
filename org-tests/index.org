Org-mode has grown a big and feature rich application. Help is always needed and
highly appreciated. If you're not a lisp programmer, you still might help to
prevent regressions and greatly improve the stability of Org-mode.

This page is meant to provide help with this kind of helping. We hope to provide
all the information needed here, and hope to create tests for non-programmers
too.

Currently we are in a very early planning phase, so will find only what we
_want_ to do. If you're not a worger yet, you may as well post ideas or code to
the great [[file:org-mailing-list.org][Org mailing list]].


* Aims

- Help all non-programmers to help:
  - Link to tutorials on debugging, emacs debugger...

- Create simple packages with test data, and place them here for download:
  - Directory trees with org-files for export-stress-testing.
  - One Org-file per bug to prevent regression.
  - Name and add corner cases.

- Create automated tests to programm against.

* Ideas for test

- Veryfy the output of tests with tools like =diff= (think /export/ here).


* Clipboard

Running a minimal emacs should suppress custom config files:
: emacs -q -l yourtest.el

Getting a list of all variables (incomplete):
: grep -r defvar lisp/*.el
