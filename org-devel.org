** Org Collector

Located in the =contrib/lisp/= directory of org-mode.

A utility for collecting properties from the headers in an org file,
running the properties through arbitrary elisp functions, and
presenting the results in a table.

The functionality of this tool is similar to the functionality of
[[info:org:Capturing%20column%20view][info:org:Capturing column view]], but this has support for processing
prior to the generation of the table.

Here is a simple example application of this utility.

#+BEGIN: propview :id "data" :cols (ITEM f d list (apply '* list) (+ f d))
