* Current Projects
Some org-mode related project currently being developed in worg.


** Org Collector

Located in the =contrib/lisp/= directory of org-mode.

A utility for collecting properties from the headers in an org file,
running the properties through arbitrary elisp functions, and
presenting the results in a table.

The functionality of this tool is similar to the functionality of
[[info:org:Capturing%20column%20view][info:org:Capturing column view]], but this has support for processing
prior to the generation of the table.

Here is a simple example application of this utility.

#+begin_comment ems better example
it might be better to put an exercise example here if someone has one.

#+BEGIN: propview :id "data" :cols (ITEM f d list (apply '* list) (+ f d))

#<<fireforg>>
** Fireforg, a Firefox extension for org interaction (EXPERIMENTAL)

*** Status
Fireforg is still experimental and the installation is not hassle free. But it's worth it :-)

*** Installation

- Install org-protocol according to its [[file:org-contrib/org-protocol.org][manual]] and verify that it's working using the bookmarks.
- Get org-fireforg.el from [[fireforgrepofile:lisp/org-fireforg.el][here]] and put the following into your =.emacs=:
    : (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/org/fireforg/")
    : (require 'org-fireforg)
    : (org-fireforg-registry-insinuate)
  and as the last line the file:
    : (org-fireforg-registry-initialize t)

- Visit [[fireforgrepofile:build/fireforg.xpi][this]] with Firefox, confirm installation of the extension and restart.

(Windows users will have to adjust: org-registry-file-xml  in Emacs
and "registry-file" in Fireforgs preferences to be the same file.)

*** Usage

**** The status bar entry

If the currently viewed url is found in your agenda files, the number
of occurrences together with all associated tags will be shown in the
status bar. A left click on the status bar entry will show a list of
all headings associated with the currently viewed url. Selecting one
of them lets emacs visit that heading.

For example, this heading in one of your agenda files:
   : * Greatest tool in the world [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]]    :Org:
will yield the following when visiting http://orgmode.org/ and left clicking:

[[file:images/screenshots/org-fireforg-screenshot.png]]

Right clicking on the status bar entry shows a menu that let's you
trigger org-protocol's "store-link" and "remember".

**** Mark links that occur in the agenda files in websites

Whenever a site is loaded, Fireforg will alter the style of all links
in it, that occur in the agenda files. The tooltip of those links is
set to contain the annotations.

This feature can be turned off in
"Tools->Add-Ons->Fireforg->Preferences->Lookup links on page load".
The CSS-style used for the marking is customizable through "CSS style
string for links with annotations" in the preferences.
Changing the tooltip can be turned off by unchecking "Overwrite tooltip for links with annotations".

*** Bugreporting and discussion

- Discussions go to the org-mode list.
- Bugreports are better not sent to the list, but rather directly to
  the [[mailto:andreas%20AT%20burtzlaff%20DOT%20de][author]] (Please add "[Fireforg]" to the subject.), because there are probably too many, yet.
 
**** A checklist for bug tracing

To create a test case put:
   : * Greatest tool in the world [[http://orgmode.org/][Org mode]]    :Org:
into one of your agenda files and save it.

If problems arise please go through this checklist to locate the problem:

- Does the file "~/.org-fireforg-registry.xml" exist and does it contain "orgmode.org"?
 - *No on either*: Send me the last content of the Messages buffer in Emacs
 - *Yes*: In the Firefox menu: "Tools"->"Error console" look for errors containing: "chrome://fireforg/" and send them to me.
