* NEXT How the files are created

* Don't edit those files manually

The files in org-api are generated automatically.  Modifying them 
manually will probably create merge conflicts.

* TODO List if possible enhancements

- Add org-api/README where you describe the way the files are created and
  where you tell people to not change those files manually.

- Have a flat list of libraries in org-api/index.org, alphabetically sorted
  but without the "* A" headlines -- it will be more compact.

- In this list, use the first line of each library as a description of what
  it is.

- Clearly distinguish between core Org libraries and the ones from
  =contrib/lisp/=

- Tell whether a function is interative or not.

- Create commands.org with the list of interactive functions.

- Create options.org with the list of customizable variables (with their
  Emacs version, if any.)

- Move [[file:~/install/git/worg/org-configs/org-hooks.org][org-hooks.org]] hooks.org in =org-api/=.
