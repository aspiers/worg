I'm having the same feeling for org-mode that I did when I first
learned to really program and use emacs.

#+begin_quote
This handy system uses a fairly simple, single-file outlining
paradigm, upon which it overlays concepts like due dates and
priorities. I find its method both non-intrusive and easy to edit
by hand, which are absolute necessities for me.

I've passed 2500 tasks logged with Org-mode!
This has been, by far, the most consistently I've used any
organizational tool on any system, ever. :)

#+begin_quote
Someone mentioned that org-mode is a bit like perl. I agree. Way back,
someone described perl as "the Swiss army chainsaw of UNIX
programming". Over the last 12 months, I think org mode has evolved into
something akin to the "Swiss army JCB of organisational software" (to
stretch a metaphor until it screams for mercy!).

#+begin_quote
I think a main reason for [Org-mode's] utility is that basic use
requires little thought. When I'm using it for brainstorming, it's
almost like I'm not aware that I'm using any program --- I'm just
thinking.

#+begin_quote
I'm continually amazed by what org can do, and also by how intuitive
it is.  It's not at all unusual that I find myself thinking that it
would be great if Org/Emacs did "x", trying what seems to me to be the
way that it would do "x" if it could, and discovering that it
functions just as I expect.

I love Org's timeclocking support, and I think you will too. Because
it's integrated with your task list, you don't have to switch to
separate application or reenter data.

I've been trying lots of different Web-based GTD task managers like

conclusion that there's nothing quite like Org for Emacs.

*BG:* We’ve got a lot more books coming out in the pipeline. [...]
The one which is my favourite is the Emacs Org-Mode Reference
Manual. [...]  Honestly, it’s the greatest Emacs mode in 20
years. [...]\\
*CW:* /Would you say Org-Mode is one of the more exciting projects in
the Free Software world at the moment?/ \\
*BG:* Definitely. Maybe it’s even /the/ most exciting. Certainly it’s
transformed the way that I organise my work, and I think it has for a
lot of other people as well, so it’s software that can revolutionise
your life, not just perform a function.

By far my favorite featureset in org-mode that muse lacks[fn:1] is the table
support, which piggybacks on calc to form more of a spreadsheet than
table support. Insanely cool.

Org-mode definition:\\
Org-mode is an emacs mode for doing anything you dream of. If it
can't do it yet, post a message on the mailing list at night, go for
a sleep, and grab in the morning a fresh copy with your features
implemented.

everything using the agenda view.

While on-topic, just want to clear up misconceptions of org-mode. It
is different from all the software/website task managers mentioned
here. You can think of it as a meta-organization tool. A org software
factory if you will. You can customize it to exactly how you want your
thoughts, tasks, notes, etc organized.  See
http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html for an idea of the sheer breadth of
options available to make it work exactly for you.  This may sound
like a lot of work, but there are a lot of sensible defaults, which is
why most org-mode tutorials that scratch the surface make it seem like
a sibling to other task management software. [...]
If I may pilfer a quote, org-mode "outshines other [task management
solutions] in approximately the same way the noonday sun does the
stars." (Neal Stephenson on Emacs)\\

* Some 24/7 lectures about Org-mode

The famous 24/7 lectures are part of the ceremony for handing out the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize][Ig Nobel Prizes]].  All speakers have to give a 24/7 lecture on their
subject. This means, they have to give a /complete technical
description/ of their work in /24 words/ (may be totally cryptic), and
then a /7 word/ explanation that is more or less /understandable for
the public/, and it may be either tongue in cheek or serious.  In
summer 2008, a few people tried to [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/7599][formulate]] such lectures about
Org-mode:

** Technical description in 24 words

These was only a single entry in the "24" category:

  - Org-mode does outlining, note-taking, hyperlinks, spreadsheets,
    TODO lists, project planning, GTD, HTML and LaTeX authoring, all
    with plain text files in Emacs (/Carsten Dominik/)


** Simple summary in 7 words

   This is only a selection of the submitted entries.  My loose
   criterion was to use entries that are either a good description or
   are funny - both valid approaches to the "7" part of 24/7 lectures.
   I also left a few entries which are not exactly seven words,
   because I liked them a lot.

   - Organize and track everything in plain text (/Bernt Hansen/)

   - Organize outlines, lists and table in text. (/Eddward DeVilla/)

   - Emacs Org Mode: your life in text (/Matthew Parker/)

   - Do work and play in plain text (/Kene Meniru/)

   - Madness? This is org-mode! [[http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUgrsNBu51nU][*Real Spartans use emacs!*]] (/Russell
     Adams[fn:2]/)
     
   - Plain text with frickin' lasers. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil][*pinky to lips*]] (/Russell Adams[fn:2]/)

   - It is the text that binds us. [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3Fterm%3Dshikaka][*Shekaka!*]] (/Russell Adams[fn:2]/)
     

   - Org-mode --- lifehacker's orgy :-P (/Dmitry Dzhus/)

   - Back to the future for plain text (/Carsten Dominik/)

Footnotes: 

[fn:1] Muse now understands the syntax of Org-mode tables, so you can use
Orgtbl-mode to get the same tables in Muse.

[fn:2] The linked text is from Adam, but the link itself has been added
by me.
