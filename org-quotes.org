I'm having the same feeling for org-mode that I did when I first
learned to really program and use emacs.

This handy system uses a fairly simple, single-file outlining
paradigm, upon which it overlays concepts like due dates and
priorities. I find its method both non-intrusive and easy to edit
by hand, which are absolute necessities for me.

Someone mentioned that org-mode is a bit like perl. I agree. Way back,
someone described perl as "the Swiss army chainsaw of UNIX
programming". Over the last 12 months, I think org mode has evolved into
something akin to the "Swiss army JCB of organisational software" (to
stretch a metaphor until it screams for mercy!).

I think a main reason for [Org-mode's] utility is that basic use
requires little thought. When I'm using it for brainstorming, it's
almost like I'm not aware that I'm using any program --- I'm just
thinking.

#+begin_quote
I'm continually amazed by what org can do, and also by how intuitive
it is.  It's not at all unusual that I find myself thinking that it
would be great if Org/Emacs did "x", trying what seems to me to be the
way that it would do "x" if it could, and discovering that it
functions just as I expect.

I love Org's timeclocking support, and I think you will too. Because
it's integrated with your task list, you don't have to switch to
separate application or reenter data.

I've been trying lots of different Web-based GTD task managers like
Remember the Milk, Toodledo, and GTDAgenda.  I'm slowly coming to the
conclusion that there's nothing quite like Org for Emacs.

By far my favorite featureset in org-mode that muse lacks[fn:1] is the table
support, which piggybacks on calc to form more of a spreadsheet than
table support. Insanely cool.

Org is a new working experience for me and there is nothing comparable

Org-mode definition:\\
Org-mode is an emacs mode for doing anything you dream of. If it
can't do it yet, post a message on the mailing list at night, go for
a sleep, and grab in the morning a fresh copy with your features
implemented.

#I think I understand the difference between /org-mode/ and /planner.el/

I have no idea how long [these files] are, probably 1000
lines each, but it doesn't matter. I can combine long winded notes
about my latest fabrication process with that thing that I have to do
on it next week, fold everything back up, and then keep easy tabs on
everything using the agenda view.

* Some 24/7 lectures about Org-mode

The famous 24/7 lectures are part of the ceremony for handing out the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize][Ig Nobel Prizes]].  All speakers have to give a 24/7 lecture on their
subject. This means, they have to give a /complete technical
description/ of their work in /24 words/ (may be totally cryptic), and
then a /7 word/ explanation that is more or less /understandable for
the public/, and it may be either tongue in cheek or serious.  In
summer 2008, a few people tried to [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/7599][formulate]] such lectures about
Org-mode:

** Technical description in 24 words

These was only a single entry in the "24" category:

  - Org-mode does outlining, note-taking, hyperlinks, spreadsheets,
    TODO lists, project planning, GTD, HTML and LaTeX authoring, all
    with plain text files in Emacs (/Carsten Dominik/)


** Simple summary in 7 words

   This is only a selection of the submitted entries.  My loose
   criterion was to use entries that are either a good description or
   are funny - both valid approaches to the "7" part of 24/7 lectures.
   I also left a few entries which are not exactly seven words,
   because I liked them a lot.

   - Organize and track everything in plain text (/Bernt Hansen/)

   - Organize outlines, lists and table in text. (/Eddward DeVilla/)

   - Emacs Org Mode: your life in text (/Matthew Parker/)

   - Do work and play in plain text (/Kene Meniru/)

   - Madness? This is org-mode! [[http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUgrsNBu51nU][*Real Spartans use emacs!*]] (/Russell
     Adams[fn:2]/)
     
   - Plain text with frickin' lasers. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Evil][*pinky to lips*]] (/Russell Adams[fn:2]/)

   - It is the text that binds us. [[http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php%3Fterm%3Dshikaka][*Shekaka!*]] (/Russell Adams[fn:2]/)
     

   - Org-mode --- lifehacker's orgy :-P (/Dmitry Dzhus/)

   - Back to the future for plain text (/Carsten Dominik/)

Footnotes: 

[fn:1] Muse now understands the syntax of Org-mode tables, so you can use
Orgtbl-mode to get the same tables in Muse.

[fn:2] The linked text is from Adam, but the link itself has been added
by me.
