#+TITLE:   org-checklist.el --- org functions for checklist handling
#+OPTIONS: ^:{} author:nil
#+STARTUP: odd

* General

  =org-checklist= provides two actions which can be triggered when a task is
  marked done. These are:

  1) Clearing the state of all checkboxes in the task.

  2) Creating, and optionally printing, a file containing a copy of the task
     with all items in the checked state removed.

* How to use it

** Quick example

   Load =org-checklist= as described in the [[* Loading it][next section]]. You will then need to
   create a recurring task.

: * Morning routine
:   SCHEDULED: <2009-02-19 Thu 08:00 +1d>
:   - [ ] Shower
:   - [ ] Brush teeth
:   - [ ] Get dressed
:   - [ ] Eat breakfast
:   - [ ] Check email

   Then add the property =RESET_CHECK_BOXES= with a value of =t=. When the item
   is marked done,

** Loading it

   =org-checklist= requires =a2ps=.

   Ensure the org contrib directory is in =load-path= and add =(require
   'org-checklist)= to your =.emacs=.

** Configurable options

   =org-checklist= has four main configurable options:

   - =org-checklist-time-format= :: the format of the timestamp added to the
     export file. See =format-time-string= for valid % escapes.

   - =org-checklist-export-function= :: org export function to use to create the
     printable version of the export file. Any of the org export functions will
     work. The default is =org-export-as-ascii=.

   - =org-checklist-export-params= :: parameters for the export function. See
     the docs for the exporter you are using for useful values.

   - =org-checklist-a2ps-params= :: parameters for a2ps-print. If you choose to
     print the exported file, these parameters will be used in place of a2ps-switches.
