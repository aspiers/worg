/A bugtracker for GNU Emacs Org-mode/
/written in Org-mode and Picolisp/

* Bugpile 
** About
Bugpile is a bugtracker for GNU Emacs Org-mode written in Org-mode
itself and PicoLisp. It will be developed during the Google Summer of
Code 2012 (GSoC), if the proposal is accepted by Google and GNU. 

** Project Goals
The Bugpile project has two goals:

   1. Develop a bugtracker for GNU Emacs Org-mode using Org-mode, Git
      and PicoLisp.

   2. Evaluate and document during the Bugpile development process how
     Org-mode, Git and PicoLisp can be merged into a single framework
     for highly efficient web-programming and content management
     (called [[file:i.org][iOrg]]).

All three tools can be considered 'best in class' in their respective
domain, and merging them into a single framework should boost
programmer productivity.

- iOrg :: a detailed description of the [[file:i.org][webframework]].
- todo-list :: a [[file:todo.org][todo-list]] for the bugpile project.
# - timeline :: the estimated project [[file:timeline.org][timeline]].
- git-repos :: development will be done using public github repos
               for [[https://github.com/tj64/bugpile][bugpile]] and [[https://github.com/tj64/bugpile-mode][bugpile-mode]]. 


* Benefits and Deliverables of the GSoC 2012 project
** Benefits for Users/Programmers
The active and dynamic Org-mode community will be able to
significantly improve the software development process by using
Bugpile instead of the mailing list only. A bugtracker written
(partly) in Org-mode itself will facilitate later refinements and
enhancements, and might help to 'spread the word' about Org-mode.

The web-framework iOrg, that should evolve during the Bugpile
development process, will enable Org-mode power-users and
programmers to produce dynamik web-applications instead of only
static websites. It will enable PicoLisp programmers to use
Org-mode for rapid production of sophisticated web-content. It
will enable Lisp programmers and Emacs enthusiasts to build entire
web-applications in Lisp. And, last not least, it will bring
together three highly efficient software tools, Org-mode, Git and
PicoLisp, into one web-framework that will boost programmer
productivity.

** Benefits for GNU
Since web-frameworks are extremely important for the popularity of
software projects, like Django, Rails, Seaside and Lift have shown for
the Python, Ruby, Smalltalk and Scala projects, a successfull
web-framework based on GNU Emacs/Org-mode could be beneficial for
GNU's popularity too. Furthermore, a bugtracker tailor-made for Emacs
users might not only be useful for Org-mode, but also for other GNU
projects, and could thus contribute to improve the quality of the
software development process in the GNU organisation.

** Deliverables
As implied by the two goals of the projects, the deliverables fall
into two categories:

- Software :: The fully functional bugtracker 'Bugpile' with a
              web-interface and a 'magit-like' Emacs-mode as an
              interface for Emacs users.

- Concepts and Documentation :: A detailled documentation of the newly
     developed web-framework 'iOrg', using Bugpile as example
     application and proof of concept.
