* Bugpile 
** About
Bugpile is a bugtracker for GNU Emacs Org-mode written in Emacs Lisp
on top of Org-mode itself. It will be developed during the Google
Summer of Code 2012 (GSoC), if the proposal is accepted by Google and
GNU.

** Project Goals
The Bugpile project has two goals:

   1. Develop a bugtracker (called Bugpile) for GNU Emacs Org-mode,
      using Elisp, Elnode, Org-mode, and a dVCS.
   2. As part of the engineering process, abstract out a web-framework
      (called iOrg) based on these GNU Emacs technologies.

A web-framework written in Elisp, with Org files used for database
functionality, is a new approach that enables interactive web
applications built on top of GNU Emacs. Bugpile is an example
application, but useful in itself.

- iOrg :: a sketch of the [[file:i.org][webframework]].
- todo-list :: a [[file:todo.org][todo-list]] for the bugpile project.
- git-repo :: development will be done using a public git repo for
               [[https://github.com/tj64/bugpile][bugpile]].
# - timeline :: the estimated project [[file:timeline.org][timeline]].

* Benefits and Deliverables of the GSoC 2012 project
** Benefits for Users/Programmers
The active and dynamic Org-mode community will be able to
significantly improve its software development process by using
Bugpile instead of the mailing list only. A bugtracker written in
Elisp and Org-mode itself will facilitate later refinements and
enhancements, and might help to 'spread the word' about Org-mode.

The web-framework iOrg, that should evolve during the Bugpile
development process, will broaden the range of possible applications
built on top of GNU Emacs. Instead of using Emacs as an editor for
writing web apps in other languages, Emacs enthusiasts will be able to
use a framework based on Elisp and Emacs itself. Thus, learning more
about their editor will benefit their programming skills and vice
versa, since their editor and their web application programming
framework are really the same when using iOrg.

** Benefits for GNU
Since Emacs should be the editor of choice in large parts of the GNU
community, such a web-framework, as well as a bugtracker written in
it, might not only benefit the Org community, but also the GNU project
as a whole.

** Deliverables
As implied by the two goals of the projects, the deliverables fall
into two categories:

- Software ::
  - A fully functional bugtracker 'Bugpile' with an interactive
    web-interface.
  - A web-framework 'iOrg' with its abstract and reusable components.

- Concepts and Documentation ::
  - A detailled documentation of the newly developed web-framework
    'iOrg', using Bugpile as example application and proof of concept.
