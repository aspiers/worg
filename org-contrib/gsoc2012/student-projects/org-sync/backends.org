Here are useful information about planned backends. 

* Bugtrackers

** Bugzilla

Bugzilla is a full-featured bugtracker written in Perl. There is a
XML-RPC and a JSON-RPC interface which Org-sync can use.

Since the JSON-RPC interface was added fairly recently in Bugzilla
(v3.6 released April 13, 2010), we should focus on the XML one.

** GitHub

GitHub hosts open source projects and provides git repositories along
with other things, notably a wiki and a bugtracker (GitHub Issues).

GitHub also provides a REST API for their bugtracker. The output format is JSON.

** Redmine

Redmine is a project management web application written in Ruby. It
has a REST API in both JSON and XML.

- [[http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api][REST API]]

** Google Code

Google has its own open source project hoster. It provides a
bugtracker. I didn't find any API for it but each the bug list can be
exported to CSV.

* TO-DO list manager

** Toodledo

Toodledo is yet another webservice to organize tasks. It features
TO-DO list, folders, calendars and more.

Toodledo has a REST API specifically designed for syncing. The output
format can be JSON or XML.

- [[http://api.toodledo.com/2/tasks/index.php][REST API]]

** Google Task

Google also has its own task manager. It's more simple and
straightforward than Toodledo: TODO-list and dates.

There's a REST API in JSON.
