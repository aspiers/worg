** How do evaluations work?

Google will pre-publish the evaluation questions for both students and
mentors. Mentors will fill out mid-term and final evaluations for
their students via the Google Summer of Code 2012 site. These
evaluations will be visible in the system to the mentor and the
mentoring organization's administrator(s). Students will fill out a
mid-term and final evaluation of their mentors online as well, and
their evaluations will only be visible in the system to the mentoring
organization's administrator(s). Program administrators from Google
will have access to all evaluation data.

Any student who does not submit an evaluation by the evaluation
deadline will fail that evaluation, regardless of the grade the mentor
gives the student. If a student submits his or her evaluation on time
but the mentor does not, then the student is in an “undecided” state
until the program administrators can speak to the mentor and determine
the student’s grade.

Students who fail the mid-term are immediately removed from the
program: it’s not possible to fail the mid-term, stay in the program,
and then have a final evaluation.

In almost all cases, students will never see their mentor's evaluation
of their progress, nor will a mentor see a student's evaluation of
her/his mentorship. However, in the case where the mentoring
organization's administrator and a student's mentor are one and the
same, the student's evaluation will be shared with the mentor. If you
are a student in a situation where your mentor is also your
organization’s administrator and you would like to discuss an issue
with the program, please contact the Google Summer of Code program
administrators. Organization administrators are expected to review
mid-term and final evaluations and to provide course corrections where
necessary. In some cases, Google's program administrators may need to
share the results of evaluations with the student and mentor, such as
to arbitrate when payment should not be made. Should this need arise,
all parties will be notified in advance.

In the unlikely event that a mentor and organization administrator do
not agree on a student’s grade for any evaluation, the decision of the
organization administrator is the final one.

In the also unlikely event that a student does not agree with a
mentoring organization’s evaluation decision at either the midterm or
the final, the student may choose to submit his/her entire project
plan, timeline and code sample to Google’s program administrators.
Google will choose an independent engineer to review the code and
arbitrate the decision. The decision of Google’s independent engineer
is final.

Finally, any mentor who misses a deadline for an evaluation of his/her
student without notifying the program administrators beforehand will
not be allowed to attend the Google Summer of Code mentor summit.
Timely evaluations of Google Summer of Code students are crucial to
us.

** What are the eligibility requirements for mentors?

Google does not have specific eligibility requirements for mentors, as
we know our mentoring organizations will be best able to determine the
selection criteria for their mentors.

** I would like to participate in Google Summer of Code as both mentor and a student. Is this possible?

We've given this question a lot of thought, and we've decided it is
best not to allow participants to act as a mentor to another Google
Summer of Code student while they are working on their own Google
Summer of Code student project. We want to make sure that each project
and student receives sufficient attention, and we're concerned that
this split in focus could create a bad experience for those involved.
Please choose whether participation as a mentor or a student is more
appealing to you and plan to apply accordingly.

** How much time is required to participate as a mentor in Google Summer of Code?

While the answer to this question will vary widely depending on the
number of students a mentor works with, the difficulty of the
proposals, and the skill level of the students, most mentors have let
us know that they underestimated the amount of time they would need to
invest in Google Summer of Code. Five hours per student per week is a
reasonable estimate.
