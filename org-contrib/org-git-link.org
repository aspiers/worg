#+OPTIONS: ^:{} author:nil toc:nil

org-git-link allows linking to specific (git) versions of a file.

* Use case

  Often one wants to link to a specific version of a reference
  document which may change in time. Thorsten Wagner described an
  important use case in his mailing list entry
  ([[http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/15774]]), namely
  linking to results in a lab book. Quote:

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  [...] Please think about the following situation: I have
  something like "... In the [graph] of the last results, a huge
  peak is observable due to measurement problems for the
  following set-up parameters ...." in my org-file and then
  several month later in a stupid act I overwrite this file by
  some very similar but different results, e.g. because I was not
  longer aware of the link and thought there is no need to keep
  this old graph with the ugly peak and replace it by something
  "better". Now the link still depicts to a graph (lets say
  without or smaller peak) and back in org-mode I might reread my
  entries check what I did several months ago... and I will be
  very confused since the graph and the written text have some
  quirks (refer to a peak where no peak is depict in the graph
  and refers to wrong measurement parameters) my boss ask me what
  sort of mess I did, which I can not explain. He claims its the
  fault of all this "linux-hacker-
  emacs-org-mode-work-only-on-text-files"-stuff blaims me to dead
  and force me switching back to use Outlook, MS Office and MS
  Windows for the rest of my life..... wooohhh that would be a
  sad story !!!!
  #+END_QUOTE

  What a sad story indeed. Collaborative editing is another case
  where linking of (e.g.) todo items to specific versions or to
  files in different branches comes in handy.

* Specifying revisions

  =org-git-link.el= defines two new link types. The =git= link
  type is meant to be used in the typical scenario and mimics the
  =file= link syntax as closely as possible. The =gitbare= link
  type exists mostly for debugging reasons, but also allows e.g.
  linking to files in a bare git repository for the experts. I
  will first show an example usage for both kinds of links before
  the syntax is defined more formally.

** Example

   In the lab book use case described above assume that the org
   file in located in =/home/user/repo/planning/labbook.org= and
   the measurement data is visualized in
   =/home/user/repo/data/result.png=. The data is so exciting that
   the relevant commit has been tagged =nobelprize=. Then the
   links in a lab book entry could read any of the following:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   - [[git:../data/result.png::master@{3.10.2009}]]
   - [[git:/home/user/repo/data/results.png::nobelprize]]
   - [[gitbare:../.git::nobelprize:data/results.png]]
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   For usage in collaborative editing, typical entries might be:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   * TODO Merge [[git:paper.tex::theirstuff][Their version]] with [[git:paper.tex::ourstuff][Our version]]
   * [[git:answer.txt::firstround][Answer]] to  [[git:report.txt::firstround][Referee report]] of our paper
   * [[gitbare:/path/to/centralrepos.git::simulation.cpp][Simulation program]]
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   In all these examples, the linked files do not even have to exist
   in the working repository, i.e. the links continue to work even
   after the files have been deleted.

** Formal specification

*** User friendy form
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [[git:/path/to/file::searchstring]]
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    This form is the familiar from normal org file links
    including search options [[info:org:Search%20options][Search options]]. However, its use is
    restricted to files in a working directory and does not
    handle bare repositories on purpose (see the bare form for
    that).

    The search string references a commit (a tree-ish in Git
    terminology). The two most useful types of search strings are

    - A symbolic ref name, usually a branch or tag name (e.g.
      master or nobelprize).
    - A ref followed by the suffix @ with a date specification
      enclosed in a brace pair (e.g. {yesterday}, {1 month 2
      weeks 3 days 1 hour 1 second ago} or {1979-02-26 18:30:00})
      to specify the value of the ref at a prior point in time

    For other ways to specify commits see the git documentation
    referenced in the [[*Bare%20git%20form][bare git section]].

**** Technical note
     From the (not necessarily existing) file path first the
     corresponding git directory is extracted. This is done in the
     following way: Starting with the directory of the linken
     file, it is checked whether

     - the directory exists and
     - whether a .git subdirectory exists.

     If not, the procedure is iterated with the parent directory.
     The link path (which can be given as a local link) is thus
     separated into an absolute path GIT_DIR to the git directory
     (without .git) and a relative path RELPATH to the file. Git
     is now called as
     : git --no-pager --git-dir=GIT_DIR/.git show SEARCHSTRING:RELPATH

*** Bare git form

    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [[gitbare:GIT_DIR::OBJECT]]
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    This is the more bare metal version, which gives the user most
    control. It directly translates to the git command
    : git --no-pager --git-dir=GIT_DIR show OBJECT
    Using this version one can also view files from a bare git
    repository. For detailed information on how to specify an
    object, see the man page of =git-rev-parse= (section
    SPECIFYING REVISIONS). A specific blob (file) can be
    specified by a suffix clolon (:) followed by a path.

** Following a git link

   Following any of the git links creates a direcory named
   =org-git-link-SHA= under =temporary-file-directory= (if it
   does not exist), where SHA is the hash of the linked file
   (blob). The file contents is saved within this directory under
   the name used in the link. This ensures that each file is only
   checked out once, even when they are referenced by different
   search strings (e.g. once by branch name and once by tag). The
   file is supsequently opened using =org-open-file=, which does
   the right thing for non-text files as well.

** Creating a git link

   As an org mode is a simple text file, a git link can of course
   be inserted directly as a string. For your convenience two functions creating links
   automatically have been defined:

   - org-git-store-link :: This function is automatically added
        to =org-store-link-functions=. When =org-store-link=
        (usually bound to =C-c l=) is called in a buffer whose
        file is in a git repository, it creates a git link to the
        file version corresponding to the current branchname and
        date. The link is then added to =org-stored-links=, from
        where it can be inserted with =org-insert-link(-global)=,
        usually bound to =C-c C-l=.

   - org-git-insert-link-interactively :: This function
        interactively asks for a file name, a search string, and
        a description. The corresponding link is then inserted at
        point. Currently the only advantage over writing the link
        directly is file completion. Completion of the search
        string with the help of current tags and branch names
        might be implemented at a later stage, if demand exists.
