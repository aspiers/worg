[[file:index.org][{Back to Worg's contibutions index}]]

If you find iCal.app the most convenient way to manage your diary, but
would still like to view your appointments in org agenda, then this
module may help.

*N.B.* org-mac-iCal.el has only been tested on OS X 10.5. Apple's
handling of ics files changed between 10.4 and 10.5 to allow Spotlight
to index events. Unfortunately, the author no longer has access to
10.4 and 10.4 support is based entirely on his memory. The author
would welcome reports of success or failure of org-mac-iCal.el with OS
X 10.4 or earlier.

* Installation
  - To load org-mac-iCal.el by default:

    : (add-to-list 'org-modules 'org-mac-iCal)

    Note that =org-modules= must be set before org-mode is loaded.

  - To view Emacs diary entries in the org agenda, ensure that 

    : (setq org-agenda-include-diary t)

    is set.

* Usage
  =(org-mac-iCal)= will import all /checked/ iCal.app calendars into
  your Emacs diary when called either interactively or as part of
  another function.

  *Warning: (org-mac-iCal) is destructive and will overwrite the
  current contents of your Emacs diary.*

** Customizable variables
   - =org-mac-iCal-range= ::

     Sets the number of months (default: 2) of events imported from
     iCal.app calendars.

     Because all-day and multi-day events are imported into the Emacs
     diary as sexps, a large number of these can cause the Emacs
     calendar view to slow down unacceptably. =org-mac-iCal-range=
     sets how many months of events to import, /centred around the
     current day/. Thus the default value of 2 imports events from one
     month in the past to one month in the future.

** Examples of usage
   The following code creates a custom command in the agenda
   dispatcher to import iCal.app events and then display the agenda:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda custom-commands
      '(("I" "Import diary from iCal" agenda ""
	 ((org-agenda-mode-hook
	   (lambda ()
	     (org-mac-iCal)))))))
#+end_src

   A common problem with all-day and multi-day events in org agenda
   view is that they become separated from timed events and are placed
   below all =TODO= items. Likewise, additional fields such as
   =Location:= are orphaned from their parent events. The following
   hook will ensure that all events are correctly placed in the
   agenda:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-agenda-cleanup-fancy-diary-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (goto-char (point-min))
	    (save-excursion
	      (while (re-search-forward "^[a-z]" nil t)
		(goto-char (match-beginning 0))
		(insert "0:00-24:00 ")))
	    (while (re-search-forward "^ [a-z]" nil t)
	      (goto-char (match-beginning 0))
	      (save-excursion
		(re-search-backward "^[0-9]+:[0-9]+-[0-9]+:[0-9]+ " nil t))
	      (insert (match-string 0)))))
#+end_src
