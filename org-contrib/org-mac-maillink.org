* Purpose

  This hack allows the user to easily copy and paste links to messages
  from the Entourage mail app into an org-mode file.
* Installation & Setup
** Create and Save Script In Entourage Scripts Menu Folder

   Installation is simple. Create a new Applescript application using the following code:

   : tell application "Microsoft Entourage"
   :    set selectedMessages to current messages
   :    if selectedMessages is {} then
   :    	return
   :    end if
   :    repeat with theMessage in selectedMessages
   :    	set theName to subject of theMessage
   :    	set theSender to display name of sender of theMessage
   :    	set theContent to content of theMessage
   :    	set theID to ID of theMessage as string
   :    	set theCommand to "mdfind com_microsoft_entourage_recordID==" & theID & " | sed 's/ /\\%20/'"
   :    	set theMDfile to the first item of paragraphs of (do shell script theCommand)
   :    	set the clipboard to "[[file:" & theMDfile & "][" & theName & "]]" as string
   :    end repeat
   : end tell

   and save it into your personal Entourage Scripts Menu Folder.  It's
   file path should be something like:
   
   : ~/user/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Entourage Script Menu Items
   
   You can also locate this folder by opening Entourage and selecting
   the Applescript/Automator icon from the main toolbar (looks like a
   scroll / on the far right).  If you select "About This Menu..." and
   click on the "Open Folder" dialog button it will open the
   "Entourage Script Menu Items" folder in Finder.

   The exact file name will be used as the menu option so if you want it to look pretty be sure and
   use something like "Copy Org Link" as the file name.

   Once you've completed this step you should be able to run the
   script by selecting the "<file name>" option from the
   Applescript/Automator icon drop menu.
** Create Entourage Shortcut Key

   After the first step you should already be able to use the script
   (see usage below); however, it will probably be easier to use if
   you assign it a hot key (like the cut and paste shortcut keys).

   In order to assign it a hot key, open "System Preferences" and
   navigate to the following location:

   : Hardware/Keyboard & Mouse/Keyboard Shortcuts

   Scroll to the bottom of the window, highlight "Application
   Keyboard Shortcuts", and click the "+" sign just to the lower left
   of the window.

   This should open a dialog box.  Use the drop menu to select
   "Entourage" as the application, then enter the exact name that
   appears in the Entourage script menu.  The default is
   "copy-org-link". Then enter the exact key combination that you
   would like to use as a shortcut in the "Keyboard Shortcut" window.
   My default is "<command> l".

   When you go back to the scripts menu in Entourage you should now
   see the shortcut next to the name of the script.
** Enable Entourage Message Indexing In Spotlight

   In order for the hack to work the user must have enabled the
   Entourage application preference that allows OS X's built-in
   Spotlight search engine to index the contents of the Entourage
   database.

   To enable this preference open Entourage and select the following
   menu items:

   : Preferences/General Preferences/Spotlight/

   Then, simply check the box next to "Include Entourage items in Spotlight search
   results" to instruct Spotlight to index your messages.

   If you haven't previously had this feature enabled it may take it a
   few minutes to index your messages, but once it has finished you
   should be able to run the script successfully.

   NOTE: This step is required because of the way that Entourage
   stores its messages (in a single monolithic database). When
   Spotlight indexes the messages it creates separate files that can
   be referenced and contain sufficient metadata to link back to the
   original message in Entoura
* Usage

  Once the hack has been setup simply highlight a message line in the
  message list window, hold down the <command> key, and press the
  assigned key.  This action will run the Applescript macro which will
  copy a properly formatted link to the message onto the
  clipboard. Simply paste the text from the clipboard into a .org
  document to create the link.

  Because of the way Spotlight indexes messages (it assigns each a
  unique identifier that never changes) the link should still work no
  matter where you move the original email within Entourage.
