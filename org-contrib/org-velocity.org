#+TITLE:   org-velocity.el --- something like Notational Velocity for Org
#+AUTHOR:    Paul M. Rodriguez

* General

=org-velocity= implements an interface for Org inspired by the
minimalist notetaking program Notational Velocity.  The idea is to
allow you to amass and access brief notes on many subjects
with minimal fuss.  

* How to use it 

Org-velocity can be used in two ways: to store and access notes from
anywhere in a universal bucket file; or to navigate any Org file.

** The interface

The central command, =org-velocity-read=, prompts for search terms.
The result is a list of all entries where those search terms appear,
either in the heading or in the text.

If there is only one result, =org-velocity= offers to visit that entry
in an indirect buffer.

If there are no results, =org-velocity= offers to create a new entry
using =org-rememember= and supplies the search terms to the Remember
buffer as its heading.

If there is more than one result, =org-velocity= displays a buffer
with the headings of all matching entries.  An entry is selected
either by clicking on it or typing the hint character beside it.  Once
selected the entry is visited in an indirect buffer.

*** Navigating Org files

The easiest way to try =org-velocity= is in an existing Org file.
First [[* Loading it][load it]], then run:

: M-x org-velocity-read

*** Using a bucket file

You can set a bucket file with:

: M-x customize-variable RET org-velocity-bucket RET 

Org-velocity will then use the bucket file as its target whenever it
is called outside of Org.

** Configuration

To configure =org-velocity=, do:

: M-x customize-group RET org-velocity RET

You may also want to bind =org-velocity-read= to a key.  Add a line
like this to your =.emacs=:

: (global-set-key (kbd "C-c v") 'org-velocity-read)
 
** Loading it (No surprises here)

The easiest way is by 

	M-x customize-apropos org-modules

Check the line for velocity.  This will cause it to be loaded every
time you start org-mode.

You'll still have to load it manually the first time.

Of course, you can also just try it out by loading it manually.

If you prefer to manually customize your emacs then make sure that the
path to org's contrib directory is in your load-path and add the
following to your =.emacs=.

: (require 'org-velocity)
