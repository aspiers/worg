* General

=org-special-blocks= turns org blocks into LaTeX environments and HTML
divs. 
  
* How to use it

** Quick Example

   After [[* Loading it][loading]] =org-special-blocks=, you can begin using blocks in
   org files.  For example, let's look at Fermat's Last Theorem:

: #+begin_theorem
: If an integer $n$ is greater than 2, then the equation $a^n + b^n = c^n$
: has no solutions in non-zero integers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
: #+end_theorem

: #+begin_proof
: I have a truly /marvelous/ proof of this proposition that this margin is too
: narrow to contain.
: #+end_proof

   This is exported into LaTeX as follows:

: \begin{theorem}
: If an integer $n$ is greater than 2, then the equation $a^n + b^n = c^n$
: has no solutions in non-zero integers $a$, $b$, and $c$.
: \end{theorem}

: \begin{proof}
: I have a truly \emph{marvelous} proof of this proposition that this
: margin is too narrow to contain.
: \end{proof}
   
   Note that the standard org markup works inside the blocks.  If you
   were to use LaTeX environments inside an org file, this would not
   be true.  Also make sure that the name of the environment is
   something that LaTeX knows about -- otherwise it will not be able
   to compile your file.

   The org file can also be exported into HTML.  In that case, the
   exported file would look something like this:

: <div class="theorem">
: ...
: </div>

: <div class="proof">
: ...
: </div>

   It is up to you to make sure that the div classes are styled
   properly.  

** Loading it (No surprises here)
The easiest way is by 

	M-x customize-apropos org-modules

Check the line for special-blocks.  This will cause it to be loaded every
time you start org-mode.

You'll still have to load it manually the first time.

Of course, you can also just try it out by loading it manually.

If you prefer to manually customize your emacs then make sure that the
path to org's contrib directory is in your load-path and add the
following to your =.emacs=.

: (require 'org-special-blocks)
