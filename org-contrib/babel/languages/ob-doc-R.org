* Introduction
R is a free software environment for statistical computing and
graphics.  R source code blocks are fully supported in Org Mode with a
wide variety of R-specific header arguments.

R source code blocks in Org Mode can be used to create R packages,
carry out statistical analyses, create graphic displays, and produce
reproducible research papers.

* Requirements and Setup
R source code blocks in Org Mode require a working R installation.
Precompiled binary distributions for Gnu/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows
are available at the [[http://cran.r-project.org][Comprehensive R Archive Network]], which also makes
available the source code for compilation on other platforms.

Org Mode supports graphical output for LaTeX documents using the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/][PGF
and TikZ graphics system for TeX]].  In order to use this facility your
R installation will need the [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tikzDevice/index.html][tikzDevice package]].  One way to ensure
that this device is loaded is to put the following lines in
=.Rprofile=: 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
old <- getOption("defaultPackages")
options(defaultPackages = c(old, "tikzDevice"))
#+END_EXAMPLE


The Emacs mode, [[http://ess.r-project.org/][Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS)]], is required for
session-based evaluation.  ESS is designed to support editing of
scripts and interaction with various statistical analysis programs
such as R, S-Plus, SAS, Stata, and JAGS. 

The following two lines in =.emacs= point Emacs to ESS and load it.
Note that you will likely need to adjust the =load-path= accordingly. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/src/ess-5.6/lisp")
   (require 'ess-site)
#+end_src
 
Finally, you'll need to ensure that =org-babel-load-languages=
includes an entry for R.  Typically, =org-babel-load-languages=
will contain many entries.  The example below omits other languages.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((R . t)))
#+end_src

** Note for Windows Users
Additional steps may be necessary on Windows. See [[http://www.mail-archive.com/emacs-orgmode@gnu.org/msg57159.html][this Org-mode mailing list
thread]] for background information. If when trying to execute R source code from
Org-mode one encouters the message =The system cannot find the path specified=, it
may be necessary to set the variable =org-babel-R-command= in
.emacs. Note the addition of =--slave --no-save= to the custom path, which are
the R defaults for Babel.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-R-command "C:/Progra~1/R/R-2.15.0/bin/R --slave --no-save")
#+end_src

Adjust the path appropriately based on your R installation.

For 64bit Windows users, the R installation process may have installed
both 32bit and 64bit binaries. The above path points to the 32bit paths; for
64bit operating systems the analog is:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-babel-R-command "C:/Progra~1/R/R-2.15.0/bin/x64/R --slave --no-save")
#+end_src

* Org Mode Features for R Source Code Blocks
** Header Arguments

There are no R-specific default header arguments.

If a =:file filename.ext= header argument is provided to an R source
block, then the output from the source block will go to the named
file. What that output is depends on the value of the =:results=
header argument.

If the value is =:results graphics= then "base" graphics output is
captured on disk, and a link to the graphics file is inserted into the
Org Mode buffer (as is also the case with the graphics-only languages
such as gnuplot, ditaa, dot, and asymptote.)  An attempt is made to
find an R graphics device corresponding to the file extension.
Currently, the following extensions are recognized: =.png=, =.jpg=,
=.jpeg=, =.tiff=, =.bmp=, =.pdf=, =.ps=, =.postscript=, =.tex=, and
=.svg=.  If the extension of the file name passed to =:file= is not
recognized, PNG format output is created by default.
    
For further clarification of =:file= and =:results=, see [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/35396/focus=35766][this thread]].

There are many R-specific header arguments used to configure R graphics
devices.  They include:

  - width :: the width of the graphics region in inches
  - height ::  the height of the graphics region in inches
  - units :: for raster devices, the units in which width and height
             are given -- =px=, =in=, =cm=, or =mm=
  - bg :: the background color defaults to "transparent"
  - fg :: the foreground color defaults to "black"
  - pointsize :: the default point size in the graphics defaults to 12
  - quality :: the quality of a JPEG image as a percentage
  - compression :: the type of compression to be used
  - res :: the nominal resolution in pixels per inch
  - type :: the bitmap type, one of "Xlib", "quartz", or "cairo"
  - antialias :: the type of antialiasing to be used when =type= =
                 "cairo" or =type= = "quartz"
  - family :: in normal use, one of "AvantGarde", "Bookman",
              "Courier", "Helvetica" (default), "Helvetica-Narrow",
              "NewCenturySchoolbook", "Palatino", or "Times" 
  - title :: string to embed as the /Title field in the file defaults
             to "R Graphics Output"
  - fonts :: an R graphics font family name -- "sans", "serif", or "mono"
  - version :: string describing the PDF version required to view the
               output defaults to "1.4"
  - paper :: the target paper size -- "special" (default), "default",
             "a4", "letter", "legal", "us", "executive", "a4r", or
             "USr", where the latter two are rotated to landscape orientation
  - encoding :: the name of an encoding file 
  - pagecentre :: if paper != "special" then a logical that defaults
                  to true and determines whether the graphic device
                  region is centered on the page
  - colormodel :: a character string describing the color model,
                  "srgb" (default), "gray", "grey", or "cmyk".
  - useDingbats :: if TRUE (default) small circles will be rendered
                   with the Dingbats font
  - horizontal :: for the postscript device, a logical that defaults
                  to true and dtermines the orientation of the printed
                  image
  - R-dev-args :: for graphics parameters not directly supported by
                  Org Mode (see below)

 See the R help page for the graphics devices (e.g., using =?png=,
 =?pdf=, =?postscript= in an R session) for additional information on
 these arguments.

 Arguments to the R graphics device can also be passed as a string in
 R argument syntax, using the header arg =:R-dev-args=.  This is
 useful for graphics device arguments that don't have an Org Mode
 header argument counterpart.
    
 The following example source block illustrates use of =:R-dev-args=
 to pass background and foreground colors.  Note that both of these
 arguments can also be passed directly as header args, using =:fg= and
 =:bg=.

#+begin_src org :exports code
  ,#+header: :width 8 :height 8 :R-dev-args bg="olivedrab", fg="hotpink"
  ,#+begin_src R :file z.pdf :results graphics
  ,plot(matrix(rnorm(100), ncol=2), type="l")
  ,#+end_src
#+end_src

** Sessions
Sessions are fully supported by R source code blocks.  They can be
used as one way to preserve state accessed by several source code
blocks.  Sessions are also useful for debugging, since it is possible
to view the values of variables created during the session.

** Result Types

R source code blocks can return text or graphical results.

The [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ascii/index.html][ascii package]] coerces R objects to Org Mode, among other markup
languages.  The [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/index.html][Hmisc]], [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xtable/index.html][xtable]] and [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tables/index.html][tables]] packages contain functions to
write R objects into LaTeX representations.

R is capable of creating graphical displays in several formats.  The
outputs supported by R source code blocks in Org Mode include:

   - bmp :: bitmap image file format commonly used on Microsoft
            Windows and OS/2
   - jpg, jpeg :: Joint Photographics Expert Group method of lossy
            compression for digital photography widely used in a
            number of raster image file formats
   - tex :: output tikz graphics language which can be typeset by
            LaTeX so the fonts for text in the plot match the fonts
            used in the LaTeX document
   - tiff :: a sophisticated raster image format that allows multiple
             pages in a document
   - png :: Portable Network Graphics is a lossless raster image file format
   - svg :: Scalable Vector Graphics is an open standard vector format
            that can be embedded in web pages and readily edited in
            open source software applications such as [[http://inkscape.org/][Inkscape]]
   - pdf :: Portable Document Format can faithfully produce anything R
            graphics can output
   - ps, postscript :: PostScript is a predecessor of PDF that does
                       not support semitransparent colors or
                       hyperlinking

When using R to produce graphical displays, you will typically set
=:results graphics=.  However, if you use the [[http://had.co.nz/ggplot/][ggplot implementation of
the grammar of graphics in R]], then you will need to set =:results
output graphics=.

* Examples of Use
** Debugging
   This section contains some tips on how to proceed if your R code is
   not doing what you had hoped.
*** Use =:session=
    Evaluate your code using the =:session= header argument, then
    visit the R buffer (i.e. the buffer containing the "inferior ESS"
    process). Then you can inspect the objects that have been created,
    and try out some lines of code. Useful R functions for inspecting
    objects include (as always in R, type a "?" followed by the name
    of the function to get help with the function)
    - str
    - dim
    - summary
*** Use ESS to step through evaluation line-by-line
    1. Use C-c ' to visit the edit buffer for your code block
    2. Use =ess-eval-line-and-step= to evaluate each line in turn

In addition to =ess-eval-line-and-step=, there are several other ESS
functions with names beginning =ess-eval-*=. They evaluate lines and
regions in different ways; it's worth looking at their descriptions
(C-h f).
** Org Mode Output from R
David Hajage's [[http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ascii/index.html][ascii]] R package creates appropriate plain text
representations of many R objects. It features an option to specify
that the plain text representations should be in Org format. This can
be particularly useful for retrieving non-tabular R data structures in
Org Mode for export.

In R:

> library(Hmisc)
> ascii(describe(esoph))

The Org Mode source code block specifies =:results org= so the output
is wrapped in =#+BEGIN_ORG= ... =#+END_ORG=.  This way, arbitrary
output can be included and easily replaced on subsequent evaluations
of the source code block.


: #+begin_src R :results output org
:   library(ascii)
:   options(asciiType="org")
:   ascii(summary(table(1:4, 1:4)))
: #+end_src
:
: #+results:
: #+BEGIN_ORG
: - Number of cases in table: 4 
: - Number of factors: 2 
: - Test for independence of all factors:
:   - Chisq = 12, df = 9, p-value = 0.2133
:   - Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect
: #+END_ORG

The results in this case are exported as a nested list structure:
#+results:
#+BEGIN_ORG
- Number of cases in table: 4 
- Number of factors: 2 
- Test for independence of all factors:
  - Chisq = 12, df = 9, p-value = 0.2133
  - Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect
#+END_ORG


The =caption=, =header=, and =include.colnames= options are useful.


: #+BEGIN_SRC R :results output org
:  library(ascii)
:  a <- runif(100)
:  c <- "Quantiles of 100 random numbers"
:  b <- ascii(quantile(a),header=T,include.colnames=T,caption=c)
:  print(b,type="org")
:  rm(a,b,c)
: #+END_SRC
:
: #+RESULTS:
: #+BEGIN_ORG
: #+CAPTION: Quantiles of 100 random numbers
: | 0%   | 25%  | 50%  | 75%  | 100% |
: |------+------+------+------+------|
: | 0.03 | 0.28 | 0.52 | 0.74 | 1.00 |
: #+END_ORG

The output exported to HTML can be quite nice.

#+RESULTS:
#+BEGIN_ORG
#+CAPTION: Quantiles of 100 random numbers
|   0% |  25% |  50% |  75% | 100% |

#+END_ORG

** Graphics Produced by ggplot2

When the =ggplot2= package is used graphics output requires =:results output
graphics=.  The following example writes the graphics output to the
file specified in the =:file= header argument.

#+begin_example
  ,#+name: r-with-ggplot2
  ,#+begin_src R :results output graphics :var tbl=foo :file r/foo-output.png :width 400 :height 300
    library(ggplot2)
    res <- ggplot(tbl, aes(a_foo_var))
    res + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) +
    geom_density(weight=2) + xlab("A foo variable")
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results:
  [[file:r/foo-output.png]]
#+end_example

** LaTeX code from R
This example summarises a linear regression fit. Usually the Org Mode
user should not have to be involved in LaTeX code generation, because
this is the responsibility of Org Mode's LaTeX export engine. In this
example, neither the printed representation, nor the value of
=summary(lm(y ~ x))= is tabular, and it would therefore require some
work to get the information in to an Org Mode table. However, the
=xtable= package can be used to output a LaTeX table. Using =:results
latex= as a header argument to the R source code block ensures that
this is returned as a LaTeX block in the Org Mode buffer and thus can be
included correctly in LaTex-based export targets.

: #+begin_src R :results output latex
: library(xtable)
: x <- rnorm(100)
: y <- x + rnorm(100)
: xtable(summary(lm(y ~ x)))
: #+end_src

: #+results:
: #+BEGIN_LaTeX
: % latex table generated in R 2.9.2 by xtable 1.5-5 package
: % Wed Dec  9 17:17:53 2009
: \begin{table}[ht]

: #+END_LaTeX

** =ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS=
 When in an Org Mode R code edit buffer with an associated R session,
 =M-x ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS= will bring the R session buffer into
 view and place point at the prompt. ESS binds this to =C-c C-z= and
 =C-M-r= by default.
