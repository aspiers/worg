* Introduction
The =make= program is a dependency-tracking build utility that is
distributed with *nix systems.  There are several =make= programs,
but they each generally look for a file named =makefile= or
=Makefile=, which contains rules for building one or more targets.
=ob-makefile.el= helps the =Org mode= user tangle a =makefile= using
source code blocks.

Currently, =ob-makefile.el= is useful only for tangling a
=makefile=.  Hopefully, at some point in the future it will support
variables. 
* Requirements and Setup

The =make= program is a somewhat unusual *nix utility because the
=TAB= character is an important part of the syntax.

Emacs includes a [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MakefileMode][makefile-mode]] for editing the =makefile= code.

For tangling to work, the variable =org-src-preserve-indentation= must
be non-nil, so that tabs aren't lost in the Org mode buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (setq org-src-preserve-indentation t)
#+end_src

Currently, there is no need to activate makefile with
=org-babel-do-load-languages=, but it won't hurt to do so.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports code
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((makefile . t)))
#+end_src

* Org Mode Features for Makefile Source Code Blocks
** Header Arguments
There are no language-specific default values or header arguments for =makefile=.
** Sessions
=makefile= doesn't support sessions.

** Result Types
=makefile= source code blocks currently don't return results. They
exist solely for tangling.
