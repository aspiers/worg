This file contains notes on using Matlab and Octave with Org-babel.

An example of an octave block in Org-babel is

#+begin_src org
  ,#+begin_src octave :exports results
  ,n = [1:10];
  ,x = 5*n+4;
  ,ans = x
  ,#+end_src
  
  ,#+results:
  ,| 9 | 14 | 19 | 24 | 29 | 34 | 39 | 44 | 49 | 54 |
#+end_src

Notice that the final line is "ans = x". Finishing the block with the
simple statement "x" will not work. In Org-babel, Matlab and Octave
return the result of the special variable "ans", which (in Octave at
least) is automatically updated with "The most recently computed
result that was not explicitly assigned to a variable". Therefore,
both "ans =x" and "x + 0" would result in the desired result being
returned, "x" alone will not.

* Graphical output
In order to get graphical output without leaving open graph windows
during evaluation, the following can be used:

#+begin_src octave :results file
figure( 1, "visible", "off" );
sombrero;
print -dpng chart.png;
ans = "chart.png";
#+end_src

The =figure= command opens an invisible graph window where the next plot commands should act.

Then, the =print= command exports the graph to a file.

:results file says to interpret the result as a file path.
