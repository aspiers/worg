* Introduction
** Brief description of PicoLisp
  PicoLisp is a minimal and pure Lisp dialect created by Alexander
  Burger. First of all, PicoLisp is a virtual machine architecture,
  and then a programming language. It is the result of a language
  design study, trying to answer the question "What is a minimal but
  useful architecture for a virtual machine?"
  
  However, PicoLisp is no academic exercise in language design. It has
  been used in several commercial and research programming projects
  since 1988. Its internal structures are simple enough, allowing an
  experienced programmer always to fully understand what's going on
  under the hood, and its language features, efficiency and
  extensibility make it suitable for almost any practical programming
  task. Some of the outstanding features of PicoLisp are:
  
- Integrated Database :: Database functionality is built into the core
  of the language. PicoLisp is a database query and manipulation
  language.

  Database entities are first class objects. They are called
  "external symbols", because they are automatically fetched from
  database files when accessed, but otherwise behave like normal
  symbols.

  This fetching from external files is completely transparent, the
  symbols "are just there", and there is no need (or even a
  function) to read or write them explicitly. Pilog (a built-in
  Prolog engine) is used as a query language.

  It is possible with PicoLisp to build large multi-user databases,
  distributed across many machines or in a cloud. Such a database
  system can be optimally fine-tuned, because all its levels are
  under the developer's control.

- Equivalence of Code and Data :: This is actually a feature of Lisp in
  general. However, PicoLisp really lives it. It makes it easy to write
  things like the HTML, PostScript or TeX libraries, exploring a syntax
  of nested function calls. This results in very succinct and precisely
  expressed programs.

  For a closer explanation, see the article [[http://picolisp.com/5000/!wiki?EquivalenceCodeData][The Equivalence of Code
  and Data]]. 
  
- Expressiveness :: PicoLisp is a very expressive language. Programs are
  often much shorter and concise than equivalent programs written in
  other languages.

  Examples of various programming tasks and their solutions can be
  found at [[http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:PicoLisp][Rosettacode]].
  
- Efficiency :: PicoLisp uses (at least when compared to other Lisps)
  very little memory, on disk as well as in memory (heap space).

  For example, the installation size in the OpenWRT distribution is
  only 575 kB (uncompressed), where the statically linked
  interpreter with 296 kB takes the largest part. Yet, it includes
  the full runtime system with interpreter, database, HTTP server,
  XHTML and JavaScript application framework, watchdog, and the
  debugger, PostScript and XML libraries.

  PicoLisp has no compiler, everything starts up very quickly, and
  code dynamically loaded at runtime (e.g. GUI pages) is
  immediately ready. Yet, the interpreter is quite fast, usually
  three times a fast as Python, for example.

** Range of typical uses within Org Mode
   At first sight, it might not be obvious why Org Mode users should
   use anything else but Emacs Lisp when writing lisp code blocks. But
   Picolisp offers at least two features that make it a valuable Org
   Babel language: its object-oriented database, and its highly
   efficient framework for interactive web-applications.

* Requirements and Setup
** Installation and configuration of PicoLisp software
   PicoLisp can be downloaded from this [[http://software-lab.de/down.html][download page]]. There is a
   32-bit version written in C, and a 64-bit version written in
   assembler. Some GNU/Linux distributions ship with PicoLisp
   packages, so you might be able to use your package manager for
   installation. A pure Java version (Ersatz PicoLisp) and a minimal
   version (Mini PicoLisp) are available too.

   Detailed and comprehensive installation instructions can be found
   in the [[http://software-lab.de/INSTALL][INSTALL]] file.
   
** Emacs configuration
   The original author of PicoLisp, Alexander Burger, does all his
   programming work using xterm and vi. PicoLisp is really living
   the old Unix tradition of simplicity and minimalism.

   However, there are no editor-wars going on in the PicoLisp
   community. Several PicoLisp programmers are Emacs users and
   contributed to Emacs to enable it as PicoLisp editor.
   
   After installing PicoLisp, you find the elisp files that constitute
   the Emacs picolisp-mode in the directory /picolisp/lib/el/. There
   is a picolisp.el and an inferior-picolisp.el as well as a paredit
   patch.

   There is another file called tsm.el. It makes PicoLisp's
   transient symbols appear in a special way in the source code,
   reminding the programmer that they look like Strings and are used
   as Strings, but are not really Strings but just (transient)
   Symbols.

   The README file in the same directory gives the necesary
   instructions for configuring the PicoLisp mode for Emacs. Since it
   is not very long, I cite it here:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; In order to get the picolisp-mode working correctly you have to
     ;; add the following expressions to your .emacs and adapt them 
     ;; according to your set-up: 
     
     (add-to-list 'load-path "<path-to>/picoLisp/lib/el")
     (load "tsm.el") ;; Picolisp TransientSymbolsMarkup (*Tsm)
     (autoload 'run-picolisp "inferior-picolisp")
     (autoload 'picolisp-mode "picolisp" "Major mode for editing
      Picolisp." t)
     ;; pil is more modern than plmod
     (setq picolisp-program-name "<path-to>/picoLisp/plmod") 
     
     ;; If you have also SLIME installed, it will suck all possible lisp
     ;; extensions up (greedy bastard). 
     ;; So in order to get the correct file-association for picolisp 
     ;; files you'll have to also add this:
     
     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.l$" . picolisp-mode))
     
     ;; If you want, you can add a few hooks for convenience:
     
     (add-hook 'picolisp-mode-hook
        (lambda ()
           (paredit-mode +1) ;; Loads paredit mode automatically
           (tsm-mode) ;; Enables TSM
           (define-key picolisp-mode-map (kbd "RET") 'newline-and-indent)
           (define-key picolisp-mode-map (kbd "C-h") 'paredit-backward-delete) ) )
     
     
     ;; By the way, don't forget to patch your paredit.el (v21) with the
     ;;  patch provided to get a smoother editing. 
   #+END_SRC


** Org-mode configuration (org-babel-do-load-languages)
   The ob-picolisp.el file is part of Emacs now. To activate PicoLisp
   as an org-babel language, simply add (picolisp . t) to the
   org-babel-do-load-languages function in your Emacs configuration
   file, like shown below: 

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; activating picolisp as org babel language
     (org-babel-do-load-languages
      'org-babel-load-languages (quote ((emacs-lisp . t)
                                         (picolisp . t)
                                         (R . t)
                                         (python . t))))
   #+END_SRC

* Org Mode Features for PicoLisp Source Code Blocks
** Sessions
*** Support or not
    ob-picolisp supports external evaluation as well as session-based
    evaluation of PicoLisp source blocks. 
*** Typical use for sessions
    Sessions preserve state, therefore the use of sessions in PicoLisp
    just like in Emacs Lisp makes sense whenever the computations rely
    on changing state. 
** Header Arguments and Result Types
*** Language-specific default values
    Depending on the kind of table data you work with, it might be
    convenient to set the following default header argument:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      ;; optionally declare default header arguments for this language
      (defvar org-babel-default-header-args:picolisp
        '((:colnames . "no"))
        "Default arguments for evaluating a picolisp source block.")
    #+END_SRC
    
*** Language-specific header arguments
    There are no language specific header arguments for PicoLisp.     

*** Combinations of header-args and result types
   Many combinations of header arguments and result types are
   supported by ob-picolisp. Like always in combinatorics, the number
   of possible combinations increases rapidly when there are several
   factors with several levels each that can be freely combined.

   The following table shows combinations of header arguments and
   result types that might make sense for a language like PicoLisp.
   Many (but nor all) of them have been tried successfully with
   ob-picolisp source blocks. 

    #+name: header-args-combinations

** Other
*** Differences from other supported languages
    PicoLisp as an Org Babel language works quite similar like its
close relatives Emacs Lisp and Scheme, for example.

However, there is one characteristic that really sets it aparts from
other supported languages: PicoLisp is not only a language, it _is_ a
(object-oriented) database and a web-framework. Unlike other
languages, that _have_ (external) frameworks and database drivers,
these features are deeply integrated inside the PicoLisp application
server framework. 

As Alexander Burger describes it in [[http://software-lab.de/dbui.html][A Unifying
Language for Database And User Interface Development]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
: Databases and user interfaces are separate
: worlds: Existing class libraries are concerned about
: visual effects and event handling, but not about
: application logic and database maintenance. It is the
: programmer's responsibility to write glue code that
: displays data in corresponding GUI fields, detects
: modifications by the user, validates them, writes changes
: back to the database, and does other housekeeping.
:                  
: [PicoLisp is] a language and programming
: environment that closes [this] semantic gap, by unifying
: database and user interface into a single application
: server framework.
#+END_QUOTE

* Examples of Use
** Hello World!
The [[http://software-lab.de/doc/tut.html][PicoLisp Tutorial]] has two versions of the notorious "Hello World"
function, one without arguments, the other with one argument:

#+BEGIN_SRC picolisp :exports both :results output
  # no arguments
  (de hello-no-args ()
     (prinl "Hello World"))
  
  (hello-no-args)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC picolisp :exports both :results output
  # with one argument
  (de hello-one-arg (X)
     (prinl "Hello " X) )
  
  (hello-one-arg "Argument")
#+END_SRC

** Common uses
   PicoLisp can be used, just like Emacs Lisp, as an efficient
   scripting language inside of Org Mode documents. Due to its smart
   and powerfull abstractions, much can be achieved in a few lines of
   code.

   From a PicoLisp programmer's point of view, the integration of the
   language into Org Babel might be usefull for literate programming
   (e.g. writing well documented PicoLisp libraries or PicoLisp
   related papers) or for convenient database report building (making
   use of Org Mode's multi-language environment and export
   facilities).

   From an Org Mode user's and/or Emacs Lisp programmer's point of
   view, two use cases might be of special interest:

   - use PicoLisp as a _real_ (object-oriented) database replacement
     for things like bbdb and eieio, i.e. as a tool for
     object-oriented lisp programming that can handle _big_ (even
     replicated) databases, offers a powerfull prolog-based query
     language (Pilog) and _speed_ (see [[http://picolisp.com/5000/!wiki?NeedForSpeed][The Need for Speed]]).
   - use the PicoLisp application server framework to enable
     interactive web-development with Org Mode, i.e. combine the
     static html-export facilities of Org Mode with PicoLisp's ability
     to produce html-forms that communicate directly with an
     underlying PicoLisp database. 

  These two use cases are still a bit theoretical, some investigation
  and experimentation has to be done that hopefully lead to the
  production of related tutorials on Worg in the future.
   
** Links to tutorials and other resources
Although not all aspects of PicoLisp are documented and the (often
surprinsingly short) source code must be used as ultimate reference in
some cases, there are many interesting and well written documents
available.

The one-stop-shop for everything with regards to PicoLisp is the
[[http://picolisp.com/5000/!wiki?home][PicoLisp Wiki]]. There is a [[mailto:picolisp@software-lab.de?subject%3DSubscribe][PicoLisp Mailing List]] too, as well as an IRC
channel (#picolisp). 

For programmers who want to learn more about PicoLisp, I would suggest
to first read Paul Graham's essay [[http://paulgraham.com/hundred.html][The Hundred-Year Language]], to get
the general idea what PicoLisp is all about. Then, a [[http://software-lab.de/radical.pdf][A Radical Approach
to Application Development (PDF)]] and [[http://software-lab.de/dbui.html][A Unifying Language for Database
And User Interface Development]] are the next logical steps to learn
more about the philosophy behind PicoLisp.

The [[http://software-lab.de/doc/ref.html][PicoLisp Reference]] and the [[http://software-lab.de/doc/tut.html][PicoLisp Tutorial]] are the main
references when it comes to 'hands on' experience with the language.
Henrik Sarvell's introduction [[http://www.prodevtips.com/2008/03/28/pico-lisp/]["At a First Glance"]] is a very helpfull
beginners guide too. 

The [[http://software-lab.de/doc/app.html][PicoLisp Application Development]] guide explains in great detail,
how amazingly easy and efficient web-programming with PicoLisp can be.
There is much more information available, just have a look at the
PicoLisp wiki yourself.
