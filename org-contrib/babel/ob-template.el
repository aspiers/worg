;;; Commentary:

;; This file is not intended to ever be loaded by org-babel, rather it
;; is a template for use in adding new language support to Org-babel.
;; Good first steps are to copy this file to a file named by the
;; language you are adding, and then use `query-replace' to replace
;; all strings of "template" in this file with the name of your new
;; language.
;;
;; If you have questions as to any of the portions of the file defined
;; below please look to existing language support for guidance.
;;
;; If you are planning on adding a language to org-babel we would ask
;; that if possible you fill out the FSF copyright assignment form
;; available at https://orgmode.org/request-assign-future.txt as this
;; will make it possible to include your language support in the core
;; of Org-mode, otherwise unassigned language support files can still
;; be included in the contrib/ directory of the Org-mode repository.

;;; Requirements:

;; Use this section to list the requirements of this language.  Most
;; languages will require that at least the language be installed on
;; the user's system, and the Emacs major mode relevant to the
;; language be installed as well.

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-ref)
(require 'ob-comint)
(require 'ob-eval)
;; possibly require modes required for your language

;; optionally define a file extension for this language
(add-to-list 'org-babel-tangle-lang-exts '("template" . "tmp"))

;; optionally declare default header arguments for this language
(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:template '())

;; This function expands the body of a source code block by doing
;; things like prepending argument definitions to the body, it should
;; be called by the `org-babel-execute:template' function below.
(defun org-babel-expand-body:template (body params &optional processed-params)
  "Expand BODY according to PARAMS, return the expanded body."
  (require 'inf-template)
  (let ((vars (nth 1 (or processed-params (org-babel-process-params params)))))
    (concat
     (mapconcat ;; define any variables
      (lambda (pair)
        (format "%s=%S"
                (car pair) (org-babel-template-var-to-template (cdr pair))))
      vars "\n") "\n" body "\n")))

;; This is the main function which is called to evaluate a code
;; block.
;;
;; This function will evaluate the body of the source code and
;; return the results as emacs-lisp depending on the value of the
;; :results header argument
;; - output means that the output to STDOUT will be captured and
;;   returned
;; - value means that the value of the last statement in the
;;   source code block will be returned
;;
;; The most common first step in this function is the expansion of the
;; PARAMS argument using `org-babel-process-params'.
;;
;; Please feel free to not implement options which aren't appropriate
;; for your language (e.g. not all languages support interactive
;; "session" evaluation).  Also you are free to define any new header
;; arguments which you feel may be useful -- all header arguments
;; specified by the user will be available in the PARAMS variable.

         (vars (second processed-params))
         (result-params (third processed-params))

    ;; possibly by dropping it to a temporary file and evaluating the
    ;; file.

    ;; `org-babel-comint' will probably be helpful.
