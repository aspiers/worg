* Description

This article is some "theming guide" about customizing the look and feel of an
Org-Babel buffer inside Emacs. We'll show you how you can improve the
appearance of source code blocks.

Note that coloring the background of code blocks with native
fontification no longer works as of [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode/commit/f8b42e8][commit f8b42e8]].

To configure "native fontification" (as in the above screenshot), set the
following in your =.emacs= file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; fontify code in code blocks
(setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
#+end_src

* Configuration File

- To get the above full contributed theme, please visit [[file:../../../org-color-themes.org][Installing Org Color
  themes]] and copy the file [[https://github.com/fniessen/color-theme-leuven/blob/master/color-theme-leuven.el][color-theme-leuven.el]] in your =load-path=.

- If you want to keep your existing Emacs color theme, and you only want to
  customize the "delimiter lines" of the code blocks, either:

  + Add the following lines to your current color theme:

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (org-block-begin-line
     ((t (:underline "#A7A6AA" :foreground "#008ED1" :background "#EAEAFF"))))
    (org-block-background
     ((t (:background "#FFFFEA"))))
    (org-block-end-line
     ((t (:overline "#A7A6AA" :foreground "#008ED1" :background "#EAEAFF"))))
    #+end_src

  + Define these faces, in your =.emacs= file, /before/ requiring Org (if you
    don't have your own color theme):

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (defface org-block-begin-line
      '((t (:underline "#A7A6AA" :foreground "#008ED1" :background "#EAEAFF")))
      "Face used for the line delimiting the begin of source blocks.")

    (defface org-block-background
      '((t (:background "#FFFFEA")))
      "Face used for the source block background.")

    (defface org-block-end-line
      '((t (:overline "#A7A6AA" :foreground "#008ED1" :background "#EAEAFF")))
      "Face used for the line delimiting the end of source blocks.")
    #+end_src

* Further extensions

When we will have some spare time, our intention is to get the reserved
keywords of Org-Babel (such as =:var= and =:exports=) somehow highlighted.
Stay tuned -- or give some help!
