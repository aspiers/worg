[[file:org-mac-link.org][{Back to Worg's Org and Mac OS X page}]]

* Purpose

  This allows you to call org-capture via Alfred to take a note
  directly into your =org-default-notes-file= org file.

  I adapted this from [[http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/76348]] and wrapped it up in github.
* Installation & Setup

  Quite simple really, add the [[https://github.com/jjasghar/alfred-org-capture/blob/master/el/alfred-org-capture.el][alfred-org-capture.el]] to your `.emacs` or `.emacs.d/init.el`.
  Then you should add the [[https://github.com/jjasghar/alfred-org-capture/raw/master/org-capture.alfredworkflow][alfred workflow]] to alfred.

* Usage
  Set up alfred for the key binding you'd like and run it!
