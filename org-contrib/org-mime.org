* General

=org-mime= can be used to send HTML email using Org-mode HTML export.

This approximates a WYSiWYG HTML mail editor from within Emacs, and
can be useful for sending tables, fontified source code, and inline
images in email.

* How to use it
** Setup
If the org-mode =contrib/= directory is in your load path, then
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-mime)
#+end_src
is sufficient to load =org-mime=.

Next you need to tell =org-mime= which Emacs mail agent you use.
- for gnus -- this is set by default
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq org-mime-library 'mml)
  #+end_src
- for Wanderlust (WL)
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq org-mime-library 'semi)
  #+end_src
- for VM -- not yet supported
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (setq org-mime-library 'vm)
  #+end_src

=org-mime= exposes two functions

- `org-mime-htmlize' :: can be called from within a mail composition
     buffer to export either the entire buffer or just the active
     region to html, and embed the results into the buffer as a
     text/html mime section.
     : org-mime-htmlize is an interactive Lisp function in `org-mime.el'.
     : 
     : (org-mime-htmlize ARG)
     : 
     : Export a portion of an email body composed using `mml-mode' to
     : html using `org-mode'.  If called with an active region only
     : export that region, otherwise export the entire body.
     *warning*: There has been some concern voiced over the potential
     complexity of email resulting from calling this function on an
     active region resulting in multiple =multipart/alternative=
     sections in the same email.  Please see [[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/23617][this email thread]] for a
     discussion of the potential pitfalls of this approach.  Speaking
     from personal experience this has not been a problem for the
     author.

- `org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize' :: can be called from within an
     Org-mode buffer to export either the whole buffer or the narrowed
     subtree or active region to HTML, and open a new email buffer
     including the resulting HTML content as an embedded mime section.
     : org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize is an interactive Lisp function in
     : `org-mime.el'.
     : 
     : (org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize)
     : 
     : Export the current org-mode buffer to HTML using
     : `org-export-as-html' and package the results into an email
     : handling with appropriate MIME encoding.


The following key bindings are suggested, which bind the =C-c M-o= key
sequence to the appropriate =org-mime= function in both email and
Org-mode buffers.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'message-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (local-set-key "\C-c\M-o" 'org-mime-htmlize)))
  
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (local-set-key "\C-c\M-o" 'org-mime-org-buffer-htmlize)))
#+end_src

** CSS style customization
Email clients will often strip all global CSS from email messages.  In
the case of web-based email readers this is essential in order to
protect the CSS of the containing web site.  To ensure that your CSS
styles are rendered correctly they must be included in the actual body
of the elements to which they apply.

The `org-mime-html-hook' allows for the insertion of these important
CSS elements into the resulting HTML before mime encoding.  The
following are some possible uses of this hook.

- for those who use color themes with Dark backgrounds it is useful to
  set a dark background for all exported code blocks and example
  regions.  This can be accomplished with the following
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'org-mime-html-hook
              (lambda ()
                (org-mime-change-element-style
                 "pre" (format "color: %s; background-color: %s; padding: 0.5em;"
                               "#E6E1DC" "#232323"))))
  #+end_src
- the following can be used to nicely offset block quotes in email
  bodies
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'org-mime-html-hook
              (lambda ()
                (org-mime-change-element-style
                 "blockquote" "border-left: 2px solid gray; padding-left: 4px;")))    
  #+end_src

group.

=org-mime= was developed by Eric Schulte with much-appreciated help
and discussion from everyone on the "[[http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.orgmode/23153][using orgmode to send html mail]]"
thread especially Eric S. Fraga for adding WL support.
