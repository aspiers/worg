Here we keep track of important changes and discussions in Worg.

* 2010-10-18 Mon - Ian
Updated org-appearance to move colour theme information to its own
page. Added information about several colour themes and screenshots.

* 2009-10-04 Su - Sebastian

  * images/icons/ :: Added icon directory and two files for info boxes.
  * worg.css :: Added styles for info boxes.

  The info boxes are used in the file =org-tutorials/images-and-xhtml-export.org=.

  Worgers:
  Please see the definitions on top of that file. Shouldn't we have a setup file
  for stuff like that?
