more productive, then you should definitely read this:

:I have been intending to write this essay for months. Why am I finally
:doing it? Because I finally found some uncommitted time? Wrong. I have
:papers to grade, textbook orders to fill out, an NSF proposal to
:referee, dissertation drafts to read. I am working on this essay as a
:way of not doing all of those things. This is the essence of what I call
:structured procrastination, an amazing strategy I have discovered that
:converts procrastinators into effective human beings, respected and
:admired for all that they can accomplish and the good use they make of
:time. All procrastinators put off things they have to do. Structured
:procrastination is the art of making this bad trait work for you. The
:key idea is that procrastinating does not mean doing absolutely
:nothing. Procrastinators seldom do absolutely nothing; they do
:marginally useful things, like gardening or sharpening pencils or making
:a diagram of how they will reorganize their files when they get around
:to it. Why does the procrastinator do these things? Because they are a
:way of not doing something more important. If all the procrastinator had
:left to do was to sharpen some pencils, no force on earth could get him
:do it. However, the procrastinator can be motivated to do difficult,
:timely and important tasks, as long as these tasks are a way of not
:doing something more important.
