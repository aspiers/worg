[[file:index.org][{Back to Worg's index}]]

To push commits to the Worg repository at http://orgmode.org/w/worg.git you
need to have a SSH key. What's that and how can you create one?

* Public and private keys

#+index: Public key
#+index: Private key

A /public key/ is like a door lock, and a /private key/ is like the
key. =Repo.or.cz= is asking you for the /public key/, that means, they
ask you to provide a lock, and they will install your lock in their
server. Then, with your /private key/ you will be able to open a
connection to the server.

Your /private key/ may be easy to use: just /have it/, and you can use
it to open the lock.

But suppose you lose it; then it's not secure anymore; any person which
has the key (which is a file) can connect to the server supplanting your
identity.

Therefore, at the computer we do that the /private key/ has a /password/
(also called "passphrase"). Then, you do not only need to possess the
key to open the lock; you also need to know how to use it (that means,
you must have the /public key/ *and* know the password).

So: *use a passphrase* for more security.

* Steps to create your private and public keys

#+index: ssh-keygen

1. Run =ssh-keygen= with no parameters. If you want to change the
   encryption algorithm used, see [[*RSA or DSA][the section below]].

2. /Location of the key/: just press enter

3. /Passphrase of the key/: enter your new password; the one you will
   type each time to be able to connect. You can have no password at
   all, but it's not recommended; read the description at the
   introduction to know why.

4. Now you have 2 new files:

 - =id_rsa=: that's your new private key. Don't share it!

 - =id_rsa.pub=: that's your new /public key/. You can distribute it.

 - You will also see a /fingerprint/ (like =31:c0:5a:92:70:5e:91=... etc).

5. Look at the public key. If you don't like the user name which appears
   at the end, re-run =ssh-keygen -C "comment that you want"Â =

* RSA or DSA?

#+index: RSA
#+index: DSA

You can decide if at the key creation you want to use the algorithm RSA or
the algorithm DSA.

If you know which one you like, you're lucky; use it!

If not, decide one; both will work.

By default, =ssh-keygen= uses RSA, but you can use =ssh-keygen -t dsa= to
use DSA.

* Appendice: How to use this key to create an account on =repo.or.cz=?

*Note*: this section was useful when worg.git was hosted on =repo.or.cz=
instead of =orgmode.org=, before december 2011.  We leave it here, so that
it is useful for other project than Worg.

1. Copy and paste the /public/ key (the contents of =id_rsa.pub=) in the
   text box in http://repo.or.cz/reguser.cgi

2. In "/login/", write the user name you want to have in this server

3. Write also your e-mail

4. Click the button "/Register/"

5. Now you must ask the administrator to give you "push"-access: to
   allow you to upload contents to the project.

6. If you chose a user name for =repo.or.cz= that is different than your
   login name, you might adjust the ssh client to use the user name for
   =repo.or.cz= name when connecting.

   This can be done by putting two lines like these in the file
   =.ssh/config=:

   #+begin_src conf
     Host repo.or.cz
          User <user at repo.or.cz>
   #+end_src
